<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">In</span> the days of long, long ago when men built
altars, and burned sacrifices, and worshiped
their gods in temples of pure white marble,
Jupiter, the greatest of the gods, sat upon his throne
on high Olympus and looked down upon the doings
of men. The topmost peak of Mount Olympus was
covered with clouds,&mdash;so high it was above all the
hills of Greece,&mdash;and its slopes were thickly wooded.
Just how high the mountain really was could only
be guessed, for no man had dared to climb even as
high as the first cloud line; though the story goes
that once upon a time a wandering shepherd, looking
for a strayed lamb, had ventured far up the
mountain side and had soon lost his way. He
groped about blindly, as the mists began to thicken
all around him, and the sound of his own footsteps
terrified him in the dreadful silence that seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
be suddenly creeping over him. Then a mighty
tempest broke over his head, and the mountain
shook to its very base. From the hand of wrathful
Jupiter fierce thunderbolts were hurled, while the
lightning flashed and gleamed through the darkness
of the forest, searching out the guilty mortal who
had dared to climb too high.</p>

<p>No human eye had ever seen the glories of
Olympus, no human foot had ever stepped within
its sacred halls, where the ceiling was of gold and
the pavement of pearl and the thrones of the gods
shone with a thousand glittering jewels. Here</p>

<p class="in0">Of the life that was lived among the dwellers on
Olympus, not even the poets could claim to know;
but sometimes a tired soldier dozing by his camp
fire dreamed dreams of this wonderful country where
the immortal gods walked by night and day; and
sometimes a lonely fisherman, looking across the
blue waters of the Mediterranean to the crimsoning
sunset, saw visions of youth and beauty and life that
lasted for ever and ever and ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
It was long before the memory of man that the
gods first came to live on Mount Olympus, and it was
still longer ago that all the great powers of the universe
fought with each other for the right to rule
the world. In this mighty war, which rent the very
heavens with the crash of battle, Jupiter at last
conquered all his jealous enemies, and made himself
ruler of the gods and of the <span class="locked">world.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span> On that day
he established his dwelling place on Mount Olympus,
and set the earth below him for a footstool. From
his throne in the high heavens he looked down
upon the kingdoms that he had portioned out to
each of his brothers; and he saw Neptune, the god
of the sea, driving through the waves his chariot
drawn by huge, misshapen sea-beasts that beat up
the thick white foam until it glistened on the sea-king's
beard and on his crown of shells and seaweed.
The other kingdom was so far away that even the
all-seeing eyes of Jupiter were strained to catch any
glimpse of the shapes that moved noiselessly there,
for this was the realm of Pluto, god of the underworld,
that dread country of darkness and unending
gloom, where no ray of sunlight ever came, and
where the sad spirits of the dead wept for the lost
world of love and light and laughter.</p>

<p>Sometimes the great billows of clouds that rolled
at the foot of the red-gold throne shut out for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
moment all sight of the earth at his feet; but however
thickly the mists gathered, Jupiter could always
see old Atlas standing on the shore of Africa with
the heavens resting on his bent shoulders. This
giant had stood so long that forests of huge trees
had sprung up around his feet, and they had grown
so tall during the ages and ages that had passed,
that their topmost branches reached to the giant's
waist and almost hid him from the sight of men.
No one offered to relieve him of his burden, not
even his two brothers, Prometheus and Epimetheus,
to whom had been given the less difficult task of
creating man and placing him in the rich gardens of
the earth. There was every kind of plant and
animal life in the gardens, and all things were very
beautiful in this morning of the world&mdash;so beautiful
that the gods, who must forever dwell in Olympus,
felt sad that no eyes like their own could look upon
the green meadows and flower-covered hillsides.
So they bade Prometheus and Epimetheus fashion
a being which should be like and yet unlike themselves.
There was nothing but clay out of which
to make this new creature called man, but the
brothers spent much time over their task, and, when
it was finished, Jupiter saw that the work was good,
for they had given to man all the qualities that the
gods themselves possessed&mdash;youth, beauty, health,
strength,&mdash;everything but immortality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
Then Prometheus grew ambitious to add even
more to the list of man's blessings; and one day,
as he sat brooding by the seashore, he remembered
that there was as yet no fire on the earth; for the
only flame that burned in all the world was glowing
in the sacred halls of Jupiter. For a long time he
sat on the seashore, and before night fell he had
formed the daring plan of stealing some of the divine
fire that burned for always and always on
Mount Olympus, and carrying it to the earth that
men might revel in its warmth and light.</p>

<p>It was a bold thing to dream of doing, but Prometheus
forgot the fear of Jupiter's wrath, so determined
was he to carry out his plan; and one night,
when the gods were in council, seated around the
great red-gold throne, he crept softly into the hall,
unseen and unheard. The sacred fire was burning
brightly on a hearth of polished silver. Some of it
Prometheus secreted in a hollow reed and hurried
with it back to the earth. Then he waited, with
terror at his heart, for he knew that sooner or
later the vengeance of Jupiter would search him out,
even though he fled to the uttermost parts of the
earth.</p>

<p>When the council of the gods was over, Jupiter
looked down through the clouds and saw a strange
light on the earth. For a while he did not realize
that it was man, building himself a fire; but when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
he learned the truth, his wrath became so terrible
that even the gods trembled and turned away in fear.
In a moment Prometheus was seized and carried off
to the Caucasus Mountains, where he was securely
chained to a rock, and a hungry vulture was sent to
tear out his liver and devour it. At night the vulture,
having gorged itself, slept on the rocks above
its victim's head; and at night the liver of the
wretched Prometheus grew again, only to be torn
out and eaten by the vulture as soon as the sun rose.
This terrible punishment kept on for years and years;
for though Jupiter heard the cries of Prometheus,
and many tales were told of his sufferings, the ruler
of the gods never forgave the theft of the sacred
fire, nor would he set Prometheus free. But the
story tells us that at last there came an end to this
cruel vengeance, for Hercules, son of Jupiter, went
wandering one day among the mountains, found the
tortured Prometheus, and broke his chains, after
killing the vulture that had been enjoying this hateful
feast.</p>

<p>Though the gods were rejoiced at his freedom,
the name of Prometheus was never spoken on
Mount Olympus for fear of Jupiter's all-hearing
ears; but on the earth men uttered his name in
their prayers and taught their children to honor the
Fire-giver as one of the greatest among <span class="locked">heroes.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span></p>

<span class="subhead">The Story of Pandora</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">In</span> the early days of man's life on the earth,
when everything was beautiful and new, there
was no sickness anywhere, nor any pain, nor
sorrow. Men lived to be very old and very wise,
and everywhere was happiness such as has never
been since in all the world. Now Jupiter had not
forgotten about the stealing of the sacred fire, and it
angered him that man should light his own fires
and kindle the cheerful blaze which should by right
be glowing only in the halls of Olympus. The
suffering of Prometheus had not softened his wrath.
He would not be satisfied until punishment was
visited upon those who had received the stolen
fire. Accordingly he called a council of the gods
and spoke to them of his desire. Though none of
the deities wished to see misfortune brought upon
the race of man, they did not dare to dispute the
will of Jupiter. So they agreed to carry out the
plan that he unfolded, and before many days had
passed they had fashioned, out of the same clay
from which man was made, a creature that they
called woman. To her each of the gods gave a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
gift such as softness, or grace, or wonderful fairness;
but Jupiter added one other quality, curiosity,
and he gave the woman the name of Pandora, which
means "the gift of all the <span class="locked">gods."<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span> Then he bade
Mercury, who is the messenger of the gods, take
this new soft thing down to the earth and give her
to Epimetheus for his wife. Now Epimetheus had
mourned apart from his fellows ever since he learned
of his brother's dreadful fate; and he sat day and
night in the cool silence of the forest, brooding over
his sorrow. But one day he saw some one coming
toward him, led by the hand of Mercury, and all at
once he forgot to be sad; for the sunlight was shining
on the woman's golden hair, and her white arm
was stretched out to him in greeting.</p>

<p>For some time Epimetheus and Pandora lived
happily in the gardens of the earth, and every day
Epimetheus thanked the gods for their last and best
gift to man. He never tired of watching Pandora
chasing butterflies through the tall meadow grass, or
making cups out of broad leaves, that she and Epimetheus
might drink from the clear, cool spring.
One day as they were resting under the trees and
eating their simple meal of dates and wild honey,
they saw a traveler coming toward them. He was
walking very slowly and seemed heavily burdened
with what appeared to be a large box. While he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
was yet some distance off, Pandora ran to meet him
and asked him to come into the shade and rest.
The stranger was old, and the chest that he carried
bent his shoulders almost to the ground. He looked
hungry and thirsty and tired, so Epimetheus urged
him to stop and rest, and offered him some freshly
gathered dates. But the traveler&mdash;who was none
other than Mercury in disguise&mdash;replied that he
could not tarry with them, for he had a long distance
yet to go. He asked them, however, to take
care of his great oak chest, for with that burden off
his shoulders he could hurry on and reach his
journey's end before nightfall. He promised to
come back for the chest a few days later. Epimetheus
and Pandora were delighted to be of service
to a stranger, and promised to guard the chest with
great care. The traveler thanked them and turned
away; but just as they were saying good-by, he
mysteriously disappeared, and whichever way they
looked there was no trace of him to be seen.</p>

<p>Epimetheus was not at all eager to know what
was in the mysterious chest; but as soon as they
sat down again under the trees, Pandora began to
ask a thousand questions as to who the traveler
might be and what the chest contained. Epimetheus
begged her not to think any more about it, as nothing
could be learned of the old man or his burden;
but Pandora refused to be silent, and talked still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
more of the probable treasure that they were guarding
for the stranger. At last Epimetheus got up
angrily and walked away, wearied with her insistence.
Pandora then went over to the chest, and kneeling
down beside it, she examined the exquisitely carved
figures that were on all its four sides. Then she
studied the fine golden cord that bound the chest.
It looked soft enough, and yet it was very strong;
for it was made of strands of twisted gold and was
tied at the end with a curious knot. There was no
lock to be seen, and apparently nothing hindered
eager fingers from opening the lid when once the
knot was unfastened and the golden cord unwound.
Pandora's fingers itched to try her skill on the knot,
and she felt sure that if she worked at it long enough,
she could finally loosen it. The figures carved
on the lid were groups of dancing children, and in
the very center was one figure whose face was so
strange that Pandora sat for a long time staring at
it. Now and then she turned away, and when she
looked at the face again, it had a different expression
from the one she had seen on it before. She knew
that this carved thing was not alive, and yet each
time she gazed into the strange eyes of the wooden
face they were quite unlike the eyes that had smiled
or frowned or mocked at her before.</p>

<p>She went to see whether Epimetheus had come
back, and finding that he was still away, she returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
to the chest again, but would not let herself be
tempted into so much as touching the golden cord.
As she stood wondering what to do, she thought
that she heard some little voices coming from inside
the chest, and they seemed to <span class="locked">say:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Open, Pandora, please, please open and let us
out."</p>

<p>Pandora looked quickly around to see whether
Epimetheus were in sight, then she came a bit
nearer to the chest and put one hand on the golden
cord. Again she heard the small voices, this time
very distinctly, and they <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Open, Pandora, please, please open and let us
out."</p>

<p>Pandora's heart was now beating fast. What
<i>could</i> be in the chest? What poor imprisoned
creatures were calling to her, begging her to set
them free? She put both hands on the golden cord,
then she looked guiltily around; but no one was in
sight, no one was watching her except some inquisitive
squirrels who were peering down at her from
the branches just above her head.</p>

<p>Swiftly and deftly she untied the knot, which
yielded easily to her eager fingers; but even then
she hesitated, fearing the anger of Epimetheus.</p>

<p>The little voices cried <span class="locked">again:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Open, Pandora, please, please open and let us
out;" but still she hesitated, not daring to raise the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
lid. Just then she heard her husband calling to her,
and she knew that there would be no chance now to
explore the contents of the mysterious chest. She
must wait for that pleasure until another time;
meanwhile she would take just one peep inside to
be sure that the voices were not mocking her. So
she raised the lid very gently, but no sooner had
she made the smallest opening than out poured a
host of tiny creatures like brown-winged moths;
and they swarmed all around her, biting and pinching
and blistering her soft skin until she cried out
in fear and pain.</p>

<p>She tried to fight them off, and rushed away to
find Epimetheus; but the tormenting little sprites
followed her, buzzing about her ears and stinging
her again and again. In vain she strove to brush
them away, for they clung to her dress, her hair, and
her poor swollen skin. When she reached Epimetheus
she was crying bitterly, and it did not need
any questioning to find out the trouble, for the
malicious little creatures were so numerous that
hundreds of them encircled Epimetheus, and bit and
stung him, just as they had done to Pandora. In
the unhappy hour that followed, while husband and
wife bound soothing herbs on their bruised skin,
Pandora told Epimetheus how her fatal curiosity
had led her to open the chest and set free the host
of evil things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
It was not, however, until later that they realized
the extent of Pandora's folly, for the little brown-winged
creatures were all the spirits of evil that had
never before entered the world. Their names were
Sickness and Pain and Sorrow; Envy and Pride
and Jealousy; Hunger, Poverty, and Death. All
these ills had envious Jupiter put into the oak
chest, and bound it with only a golden cord. He
knew that sooner or later Pandora would open the
chest, and then man's life of untroubled happiness
would be forever at an end. Never again could
the gardens of the earth be places where man
might hope to find peace. Evil things had taken
up their dwelling there, and they would stay for
always and always and always, as long as the world
should last.</p>

<p>When Epimetheus and Pandora saw the hateful
winged creatures settling down on the leaves and
flowers so as to be near at hand to torment them,
they wept bitter tears and wished that the gods had
never created them. In the midst of her sobbing
Pandora had not, however, forgotten about the
chest, and she was still wondering what else might
be inside it, for she was sure that those mothlike
things could never have wholly filled it. Suddenly
she heard a wee soft whisper coming from
within the chest, and it said: "Open, Pandora, please,
please open and let me out."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Pandora stared in surprise, for she had thought
that all the evil sprites had rushed out in that
moment when she raised the lid. Was there, then,
another host of tormenting things still there; and
if so, should she let them out to add to her misery
and pain?</p>

<p>Again the little soft voice cried: "Open, Pandora,
please, please open and let me out."</p>

<p>Pandora now called to Epimetheus, and together
they listened to the pleading voice which was so
very soft and sweet that they were sure it could
not belong to any evil thing. Still Epimetheus
was unwilling to risk bringing any more trouble
into the world; but in spite of her remorse, Pandora
was curious to see what it was that was begging
so plaintively for freedom. So with Epimetheus's
consent she opened the lid once more, and out
fluttered a tiny little creature with beautiful gauzy
wings. She flew straight to Pandora, then to
Epimetheus, and at her touch all their hurts were
healed and all their pain forgotten.</p>

<p>The name of this gentle messenger was Hope;
and she had been hidden in the chest secretly by
one of the pitying gods, who grieved that Jupiter
was sending so many ills to fret mankind. The
host of evil beings, once set free, could never again
be shut up in their narrow prison; but wherever
they flew&mdash;even to the remotest corner of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
earth&mdash;Hope followed them and brought healing
in her wings; and when the world grew wicked,
as it did in the days that came after, so that men
neglected the altars of the gods, Hope was still
remembered with votive offerings and her shrines
kept garlanded with flowers.</p>

<span class="subhead">The Deluge</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> children of Epimetheus and Pandora
wandered in the gardens of the earth just as
their parents had done; and the generations
that followed them lived peacefully and were happy,
in spite of the brown-winged sprites that went about
doing mischief. Men helped each other to cultivate
the fruitful soil, and offered sacrifices to the gods in
return for a bountiful harvest.</p>

<p>This golden age of the world's history might
have lasted forever if men had continued to reverence
the gods; but after a time they ceased to offer
prayers for health and safety, and boasted proudly
of their own strength. They looked no more to
high Olympus for help, but each man trusted to his
own right arm. Then strife and discord arose, and
fierce wars were fought among all the peoples of the
earth. Brother killed brother, and fathers strove
with their own sons. Every man's hand was
against his fellow, and he knew no law but that of
his own will. Seldom now were the fires kindled
on the neglected altars, and the smell of burnt offerings
dear to the gods no longer mingled with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
smoke that rose up to the white clouds around
Olympus. The sacred vessels moldered in forsaken
temples; around the shrines of the gods
the snakes crawled lazily; and the bat and owl
dwelt undisturbed among the pillars of the temples.</p>

<p>For a time the gods sat patient, believing that
this state of things could not last; but seeing that
mankind was growing worse instead of better, year
by year, they determined to put an end to godlessness
and to destroy the whole race of man. Then
Jupiter called a council of the gods to decide on the
most effective way of wiping out every vestige of
human life so completely that not one soul would
be left to tell to his children the story of those evil
days, when men neglected to worship the immortal
gods and allowed their temples to decay.</p>

<p>The most terrible punishment to visit upon man
would be to set the whole world on fire, to make of
it one great sacrificial altar on which human victims,
and not the garlanded ox, would burn night and
day, and from which the smoke would rise up into
the heavens so thickly that it would shut out the
sight of a blackened and smouldering earth. The
one objection to carrying out this plan was the fear
lest the flames would leap so high that they would
reach even to lofty Olympus, and so endanger the
sacred throne of Jupiter. Though the fire might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
not utterly destroy it, the gods could not bear to
think of its burnished red-gold base being touched
by any flame from earth's unholy fires.</p>

<p>The only other effective method of destruction
was water, and this the gods decided to employ.
So on a certain day when men were everywhere
feasting, and singing songs, and boasting of their
victories in battle, Jupiter rent the heavens with a
mighty thunderbolt, whose crashing drowned all
sounds of merriment, and made men turn pale with
fear. The skies opened, and the rain poured down
in torrents; the rivers became swollen and flooded
their banks; the waves of the sea, rising higher and
higher, swept in great fury over the land, washing
everything before them like so much chaff. Æolus,
god of the storm, opened the cave where he kept
the winds securely bound, and let them loose to
work havoc on the earth. Soon all the lowland was
covered with water; not a dry spot remained anywhere
but on the hills, and thither the terrified
people rushed in the vain hope that the flood would
subside before the mountains were submerged. But
the waves rose higher and higher; and the winds,
rejoicing in their freedom, beat up the water until it
almost touched the clouds. The frail boats to
which men had at first desperately clung were shattered
to pieces in the fury of the storm, and on the
crest of the waves the bodies of the dead were tossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
like playthings. Higher and higher rose the water,
until at length the mountain tops were covered, and
all dry land had disappeared. So were the gods
avenged.</p>

<p>There was one spot, however, that was not yet
hidden under the waters, and this was the top of
Mount Parnassus, the highest hill of Greece. To
this place of refuge had fled Deucalion and his wife
Pyrrha, two virtuous souls who alone, of all the
people on the earth, had lived uprightly and worshiped
the gods. When Jupiter saw them standing
on the top of Mount Parnassus and weeping over
the universal destruction, he remembered their piety
and decreed that their lives should be spared.
So he gave commands that the rains and the floods
and the winds should cease, and the dry land appear.
Then Æolus brought the winds back from their
mad wanderings and bound them again in the cave.
Neptune blew upon his conch-shell, and the angry
waves returned again to the sea. Little by little
the tree-tops showed above the water, and the green
earth smiled again under the warm rays of the <span class="locked">sun.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span></p>

<p>But it was upon a desolate and unpeopled world
that the eyes of Deucalion and Pyrrha rested, and
in their utter loneliness they almost wished that they
had perished with their friends. They went slowly
down the mountain-side, not knowing where to go,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
being led blindly by the will of the gods to the
temple at <span class="locked">Delphi<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span>&mdash;the only building that was not
destroyed. To this sacred spot men had been wont
to come in the old, god-fearing days to consult the
wishes of the gods and to learn their own destinies.
Here was the divine oracle that not even the most
daring mortal would refuse to obey.</p>

<p>When Deucalion and Pyrrha found themselves
at the temple of Delphi, they made haste to consult
the oracle, for they wished to repeople the land before
another morning's sun could look down upon
a lifeless earth. To their surprise the oracle returned
them this <span class="locked">answer:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Depart from here with veiled heads and throw
your mother's bones behind you."</p>

<p>This command seemed impossible to obey; for
they could never hope to find any grave, when all
landmarks had been washed away; and, even could
they do so, it was an unheard-of sacrilege to disturb
the bones of the dead. Deucalion sought, therefore,
to explain the strange words of the oracle in some
other way; and at length he guessed the meaning
of the god's answer. It was no human remains
that he was commanded to desecrate; the bones
referred to were those of Mother Earth. So husband
and wife left the temple with veiled heads;
and as they went they gathered up the stones at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
their feet and threw these behind them. All the
stones that fell from the hands of Deucalion turned
into men, and those that Pyrrha dropped became
women.</p>

<p>Thus it was that through the kindness and wisdom
of the immortals the earth was repeopled with a
new race of men that feared evil, and reverenced
piety, and walked humbly before the gods. Never
again was Jupiter forced to send a deluge on the
earth, for men no longer let the altar-fires burn low,
nor did they neglect to offer sacrifices because of
forgotten prayers.</p>

<span class="subhead">Minerva</span></h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">Although</span> the brown-winged spirits of
evil were kept busy flying up and down the
earth, their mischief-making never reached
those immortal ones who dwelt above the cloud-wrapped
summit of Olympus. It was, therefore, a
most unheard-of happening when the Father of the
gods complained one day of a terrible pain in his
head. Some of the gods were skilled in the art of
healing; but no one could relieve Jupiter's suffering,
nor tell what might be the cause of his pain. The
trouble grew worse and worse until it was too severe
for even a god to endure; so Jupiter bade his son
Vulcan take an ax and split open his head. Not
daring to thwart the divine will, Vulcan tremblingly
obeyed; and at the first blow a marvelous thing
occurred, for out of Jupiter's head sprang a maiden
clad in armor and bearing a spear in her hand.
This was Minerva, goddess of wisdom, so called
because she came full-grown from the mighty brain
of Jupiter. So wise did the Ruler of the gods find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
this child of his to be, that he kept her constantly
near him, and sought her counsel in dealing with
the affairs of men, while Juno, his stately wife, stood
jealously by, envying the warrior-maiden her place
at Jupiter's <span class="locked">side.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span></p>

<p>Being born equipped for battle, Minerva delighted
in war, and had no feminine shrinking from the
noise of clashing steel or the cries of struggling men.
No Trojan hero gloried in the war more exultingly
than she, as she carried aloft the terrible shield of
Jupiter&mdash;"the Ægis"&mdash;and bore in her hand the
mighty spear, "heavy and huge and strong."
When armies met in battle, the goddess was never
far away from the fighting hosts; and ofttimes a
dying soldier, turning his eyes for a last look at his
comrades, saw the glint of her spear or the flash of
her shield as she led the favored ones on to victory.</p>

<p>But the azure-eyed Minerva was not always on
the battle-field, for in spite of her warlike appearance
she had many very feminine tastes, and among
them was a love of weaving. Often would white-armed
Juno taunt Minerva with her unwomanly
fondness for warfare; but when the goddess took
up her weaving, even jealous Juno could not
withhold her praise, for the hand that could wield a
spear like a man had also the delicate touch of a
woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
Now there lived on the earth a maiden named
Arachne, who was very proud of her skill in weaving,
and boasted that in the whole length and
breadth of the land there was no one to equal her in
this art. Whenever people spoke with her, she
could talk of nothing else but her work; and if a
stranger stopped to rest at her door, she would be
sure to show him her weaving and to ask him whether
in all his wanderings he had seen anything to surpass
it. Soon she grew so conceited that she dared
to compare herself with the goddess Minerva, and
boasted that her own work was as beautiful as anything
that hung in the halls of Olympus. Her
friends grew frightened at her rash speech, and
begged her not to let her foolish pride go too far, lest
some whisper of her boasting should reach Minerva's
ears. But Arachne only grew bolder, and said
openly that she would not be afraid to challenge the
goddess to a contest. These words were overheard
by Apollo's raven, who flew quickly back to Olympus
to tell what he had seen and heard.</p>

<p>Minerva had known for some time of Arachne's
boasting, but she had not deigned to notice it.
Now, however, when she learned that a mortal
maiden had dared to claim superiority to a goddess,
she grew very angry and determined to punish such
presumption. So she cast off her glittering armor
and laid aside her long spear, and went down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
earth in the disguise of an old woman. She found
Arachne seated on the doorstep, weaving; and as she
stopped to admire the girl's work, even Minerva
was forced to admit that the weaving was beautifully
done. Soon Arachne began to boast proudly of her
skill and told the pretended old woman that she
hoped some day to challenge the goddess Minerva
to a contest. The listener seemed shocked at these
daring words, and begged the maiden to be more
humble and not to presume too far; but Arachne only
tossed her head and laughed, saying that she wished
the goddess would hear her and accept the challenge.</p>

<p>At these bold words Minerva's anger broke out,
and throwing off her disguise she commanded the
astonished girl to fetch two looms and set them up
in the doorway. Then she bade Arachne make
good her boast. For hours they worked in silence,
each weaving with practiced fingers an exquisite design
in the tapestry; and neither one turning her
head to watch her rival's progress. When the last
thread was tied and the work finished, Arachne
looked anxiously at the goddess's loom, and one
glance was sufficient to assure her of her own failure.
Never in all her life had she seen work so faultlessly
done, and the beauty of it was like that of visions
in a dream.</p>

<p>Humiliated at her defeat, and too proud to endure
the taunts that she felt awaited her from those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
who had heard her boast, the unhappy maiden tried
to hang herself. But Minerva would not let the
world so easily forget how a mortal had dared to
challenge a goddess; so when she saw Arachne's
body hanging by a rope, she quickly changed her
into a spider, and bade her spin and spin as long as
she lived. Thus when strangers came from all the
country round to see the maiden whose skill in
weaving had been noised far and wide, there she
hung&mdash;an ugly black spider in the midst of her
dusty web&mdash;a warning to all mortals who presume.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Many, many years had passed since Epimetheus
and Pandora wandered in the gardens of the earth;
and many, many generations of men had come and
gone since the day when Deucalion and Pyrrha
looked down from Mount Parnassus upon an unpeopled
land. Cities had been built, with marble
palaces and costly temples. Towns had sprung up
on river-banks and by the sea. Everywhere man
was making for himself a home, and journeying into
strange and distant lands. The gods, seated in the
council-hall of Jupiter, watched the changes taking
place upon the earth; and as each new city was built
and the flames of its altar-fires rose up toward the
white clouds around Olympus, they smiled upon the
work of man's hand and made it prosper. Nowhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
was the worship of the gods forgotten, but in each
undertaking the protection of some deity was sought
and a sacrifice offered that success might be assured.
Scattered throughout the land, in town or by the
wayside, were shrines where the farmer laid his
offering of doves in return for a rich harvest, or a
soldier hung some trophy of victory upon his safe
return from the war or a sailor, starting on some
uncertain voyage, burned spices and incense that
the gods might grant favoring winds to all those
who go down to the sea in ships.</p>

<p>But in every city there was one temple more
beautiful than the rest, and this was dedicated to
that particular deity who had named the city and
was its especial protector; and as city after city was
built throughout the fair land of Greece, each of the
gods wished to have the naming of it that he might
thereby receive added worship and honor. There
was much jealousy among them on this score, and
they watched eagerly each thriving inland town or
seaport, knowing that in a few years it would become
a great city, building costly temples and
erecting statues to the god whom it delighted to
honor.</p>

<p>So once, when a certain town on the coast of
Greece began to grow into a large and prosperous
city, there was much dispute in the council hall of
Jupiter as to who should have the privilege of naming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
it. Perhaps the gods were looking far into the
future and saw what this city was destined to become;
but however that may be, the gods and goddesses
argued so fiercely over the matter that Jupiter
was obliged to interfere, lest some murmur of this
unusual discord should reach the earth. Then one
by one the various contestants withdrew until only
Neptune and Minerva were left to dispute over
their respective rights to the naming of the city.
There being no ground for either's claim, Jupiter
at length decided to give the much-coveted honor
to whichever of these two should present the most
useful gift to the people of the city.</p>

<p>Neptune then struck the ground with his trident,
and where the earth opened there sprang out a horse
with snow-white mane and arching neck and a splendid
body on which a king might be proud to ride.
The gods and goddesses who had assembled to witness
the contest were delighted with Neptune's gift,
and waited impatiently to see what better thing
Minerva would be able to offer. Surprise, amusement,
and contempt were written on the faces of the
spectators when the goddess stepped forward, holding
in her hand an olive branch. But Jupiter, wisest
of them all, did not smile, for he was listening while
Minerva told of the great value her gift would have
for the people of the new city. She described all
the uses to which its leaves, its fruit, and even its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
bark could be put, adding that the olive branch was
to be a sign of peace among all nations, and was
therefore of more true service to man than a war-horse,
which would bring upon him only bloodshed
and disaster. To these wise words the gods were
forced to agree, so to Minerva was granted the
privilege of naming the city; and as she was called
Athena, by the Greeks, she named the place Athens,
which it is called to this very day. Before many
years passed a splendid marble temple was built on
the hill just above the city, and this was dedicated
to Athena, whose colossal statue, carved by the famous
sculptor Phidias, adorned the interior. They
called this temple the <span class="locked">Parthenon,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span> and from the
ruins that still remain we know that the hand
of man has never built anything to equal it in
beauty.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">There</span> would have been but little trouble
between Jupiter and his stately wife if no one
but Minerva ever gave the watchful <span class="locked">Juno<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span>
cause for jealousy; but other goddesses, and even
mortal maidens, found favor in the eyes of Jupiter,
and for their sake he often left her side. From his
throne in the high heavens the ruler of the world
saw not only the goddesses, with their glory of
immortal youth, but also the daughters of men
endowed with that same beauty and grace which
the gods themselves had bestowed upon the first
woman. Though Juno "of the snow-white arms"
alone enjoyed the title of queen of heaven, she
knew that she had many rivals for the love of
Jupiter; and it was this jealousy of all loveliness
in woman that made her ever watchful and revengeful.
Perhaps it was the cause, too, of the very
changeable temper that her husband accused her
of possessing.</p>

<div id="ip_30" class="figcenter" style="width: 467px;"><img src="images/i030.jpg" width="467" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">Apollo Belvedere</div></div>

<p>Whoever won the affections of Jupiter was sure
to be persecuted by "cruel Juno's unrelenting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
hate," as the poet Virgil says; but this did not
hinder the ruler of the gods from leaving very often
the marble halls of Olympus to wander, in some disguise,
about the earth. It was after such an absence
that the watchful Juno learned of Jupiter's
love for fair-haired Latona, goddess of dark nights.
As this new rival was not a mortal maiden who
could be punished with death, the wrathful queen
was forced to be content with banishing the goddess
forever from Olympus, and compelling her to live
upon the earth. Not satisfied with this, she decreed
that any one who took pity on the unhappy goddess,
or gave her any help, would incur the lasting
displeasure of Juno.</p>

<p>For days and nights Latona wandered, not daring
to ask for food or shelter, since all men knew of
Juno's decree. She slept at night in some spot
where the trees offered protection from wind and
rain, and her only food was the scanty store that
she could gather by the way&mdash;berries, nuts, wild
honey, and sometimes bits of bread dropped by
children in their play. One day, being very thirsty,
she stopped beside a clear pool to drink; but some
reapers who were passing by saw her, and hoping
to gain favor with Juno they stepped into the pool
and stirred up the water into such muddiness that
poor Latona could not drink. Angered by such
uncalled-for cruelty, the goddess prayed to Jupiter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
that these wicked men might never leave the spot
where they were standing. Jupiter from his throne
in the high heavens heard her prayer, and in answer
he turned the reapers into ugly green frogs
and bade them stay forever in the muddy pool.
And ever afterward when men came upon slimy
ponds, where rank weeds grew and the water oozed
from muddy banks, there they found the blinking
frogs&mdash;even as Jupiter had willed.</p>

<p>After wandering some miles further Latona came
at last to the seashore and here she begged Neptune,
"the god who shakes the shores," to come
to her aid, for she knew that Juno's power did
not extend to the ruler of the sea. Seeing her
distress, and pitying the poor persecuted goddess,
Neptune sent her a dolphin, who took her on his
back and swam with her to the floating island of
Delos, which the kindly sea-god had caused to
appear out of the depth of the ocean. Here Latona
landed, and was for a time content; but the rocking
of the island soon grew unbearable, and she begged
the aid of Neptune a second time. He obligingly
chained the island to the bottom of the Ægean
Sea, and Latona had no further cause for complaint.
On this island were born her two children:
Apollo, god of the sun, and Diana, goddess
of the moon.</p>

<p>When the children were grown, Jupiter took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
them to Olympus, though not without much protest
from the ever-jealous Juno. The young Apollo's
beauty and his skill in music gained him great favor
among the gods, and found him worshipers in
every town and city throughout the land of Greece.
So conscious of his power did Apollo become, that
he sometimes dared to assert his authority, unmindful
of the will of Jupiter; and on one occasion he
so angered his divine parent that he was banished
to the earth, and made to serve Admetus, king of
Thessaly.</p>

<p>In spite of his disgrace, Apollo managed to cheer
his lonely hours of labor with his music; and as his
work was no more difficult than to care for the
king's sheep, he had abundant leisure to play upon
his lyre while his flocks grazed on the sunny hillsides.
As soon as he touched the strings, all the
wild things in the forest crept out to hear. The
fox came slinking from his hole among the rocks,
and the timid deer drew close to the player and
stayed beside him, listening. The strains of the
wonderful music were carried across the meadows,
and the mowers stopped their work, wondering
where the player might be. One day they brought
word to the king that some god must be among
them, for no mortal could produce such music as
they had heard. So Admetus sent for the shepherd,
and when the youth stood before him, he marveled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
at his great beauty, and still more at the golden
lyre that Apollo held in his hand. Then when the
young musician, in obedience to the king's command,
began to play, all those who heard him were filled
with wonder, and felt sure that a god had come
to dwell among them. But Admetus asked no
questions, only made the youth his head shepherd
and treated him with all kindness.</p>

<p>Though a god, and no true shepherd, Apollo
served the king faithfully, and when, at last, his
time of service was over and Jupiter called him
back to Olympus, Apollo, wishing to show some
favor in return for the king's kindness, begged for
Admetus the gift of immortality. This request
the wise Jupiter granted, but only on the condition
that when the time came for the king to die, some
one could be found to take his place. Apollo
agreed to these terms, and Admetus, knowing the
conditions on which the gift was made, accepted his
immortality gladly. For a time all went well; but
the inevitable hour came when the Fates decreed
that Admetus's life was ended, and that he must go
the way of all mortals unless some one would die in
his stead. The king was much beloved by his people;
but no one's devotion to his sovereign was great
enough to inspire him to make the needed sacrifice.</p>

<p>Then Alcestis, the beautiful wife of Admetus,
learned of the price that must be paid for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
husband's immortality and gladly offered her life
in exchange for the king's. So, in all her young
grace and beauty, she went down into the dark
region of Hades, where no sunlight ever came
and where her joyous laughter was forever hushed
in the silence that reigns among the dead. Thus
Admetus gained immortality; but his happiness
was too dearly bought, for as the days went by he
mourned more and more for his beautiful young
wife, and in his dreams he saw her walking like a
shadow among the grim shapes that move noiselessly
in the silent halls of death. Bitterly he repented of
his selfishness in accepting the sacrifice of her life,
and his immortality grew hateful to him since each
day only added to his sorrow. So he prayed to
Apollo to recall his gift, and to give him back his
wife Alcestis. It was not in the power of that god to
change a decree of Jupiter's; but the Ruler of all
things looked down from heaven, and, seeing the
great grief and remorse of Admetus, he withdrew the
gift that had cost the king so dear, and sent Hercules
to the kingdom of Pluto with commands to let
Alcestis go. Very gladly the god carried this message
to the gloomy realm of Hades, where amid the
myriad shadow-shapes he sought and found Alcestis;
and out of the dreadful darkness in which she walked
alone, Hercules led her back to earth <span class="locked">again.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span></p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">When</span> Apollo left King Admetus and returned
to the halls of Olympus, he had
not rested there long before he found that
there was further service for him to render on the
earth. Among the many noted deeds that he performed,
the most famous was his slaying of a monstrous
serpent called the Python, which was born of
the slime that remained on the surface of the earth
after the <span class="locked">Deluge.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span> Apollo killed the creature with
his golden arrows, and then went to the help of
Neptune, who, though a powerful deity in his own
realm, was often obliged to ask help of the other
gods when he wished to accomplish anything on
land. Hearing that Neptune wished to build a
great wall around the city of Troy, and remembering
the aid that the sea-god had given his mother
Latona in her great need, Apollo went down to the
sea and offered his services to Neptune. Of course
no son of Jupiter could be expected to do the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
of a slave, but this was not necessary, even in the
building of a wall; for Apollo sat down on a grassy
bank near by, and, with his lyre in his hand, began
to play such exquisite music that the very stones
were bewitched, and rising from the ground of their
own accord took their places in the wall. Still
under the spell of Apollo's music, others followed
in quick succession, and the wall rose higher and
higher, until before nightfall the whole work was
finished. When the last stone had dropped into
place, Apollo stopped his playing and returned to
the bright halls of Olympus; while Neptune, shaking
the salt spray from his shaggy eyebrows, stared
hard at the walls that had risen by magic before his
wondering eyes.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The story of Arachne's sad fate should have been
warning enough to all mortals not to compare themselves
with the gods; but such was the pride of a
certain youth named Marsyas that he boasted openly
of his skill in flute-playing, and dared to proclaim
himself the equal of Apollo. Now Marsyas had
not always been a musician, for he was by birth a
shepherd&mdash;some even say a satyr&mdash;and had never
seen a flute or heard it played until one day, as he
sat tending his flock on the bank of a stream, he
heard sounds of music coming from some spot near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
by. He was very curious to see who the musician
might be, but he dared not move lest he startle the
player and make the beautiful melody cease. So he
sat still and waited; and presently there came floating
down the stream a flute&mdash;something that Marsyas
had never seen before. He hurriedly snatched it
out of the water, and, no longer hearing the wonderful
music, he guessed that it had come from the
strange thing he held in his hand. He put the flute
to his lips, and lo, the same sweet melody greeted
his ears, for the flute was not a common thing such
as any man might use&mdash;it was a beautiful instrument
that belonged to no less a person than Minerva.
The goddess had hidden herself on the bank of
the stream and had been trying her skill as a flute-player;
but chancing to look down into the water,
she saw her puffed-out cheeks and distorted features
and angrily threw the flute into the stream. Thus
it had come into Marsyas's possession; and the
shepherd, having found such a treasure, never let it
leave his hands. He neglected his work and left
his flocks unguarded while he spent all his days in
the delight of flute-playing.</p>

<p>It was not long before he believed himself to be
the greatest musician in all Greece; and then it was
only a step further to declare that even Apollo could
not equal him in the sweetness of his playing. The
god of music allowed this boasting to go for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
time unpunished; but at last he grew angry at the
presumption of the shepherd boy, and summoned
Marsyas to a contest in which the nine Muses were
to be judges. Nothing daunted, Marsyas accepted
the challenge; and on the morning when the contest
took place, a great silence fell over all the earth,
as if every living thing had stopped to listen. The
playing of Marsyas was wonderfully sweet, and as
the soft tones of his flute greeted the listeners' ears
they sat as if under a spell until the last sounds died
away. Then Apollo took up his golden lyre, and
when he struck the first chords, the air was filled
with music far sweeter than any melody that had
fallen from the lips of Marsyas. The judges, however,
found it hard to give a verdict in favor of either
musician; so a second time Marsyas began to play,
and his music was so strangely wild and sweet that
even Apollo listened in delight. But, charmed as
he was by the youth's playing, the god of music
had no intention of being outdone by a shepherd;
so when he took up his golden lyre again, he began
to sing, and added the wonder of his voice to the
sweetness of his playing. When the singing ended
there was no longer any doubt to whom the victory
belonged; and Marsyas was forced to admit
his defeat. As the price of failure was to be the
terrible penalty of being flayed alive, the wretched
Marsyas had to submit to this cruel death. Apollo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
bound him to a tree and slew him with his own
hands.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>When the news of Marsyas's dreadful fate spread
abroad, people were careful for many years not to
anger any of the deities by presuming to rival
them; but in time the memory of that tragic event
faded away, and the horror of it was forgotten.</p>

<p>In the halls of King Midas was the noise of
great mirth and feasting, and the sound of music
filled the spacious room where the king and his
court sat at the banquet-table. Beside the king
stood Pan, his favorite flute-player, who was no
other than the famous sylvan god of shepherds;
and as the wine went round and the king grew
boastful of his possessions, he exclaimed loudly
that not even Apollo himself could produce such
exquisite music as fell from the flute of Pan. The
guests, remembering the fate of Marsyas, grew pale
and begged the king not to let his boast be heard;
but Midas laughed scornfully and, raising his drinking
cup above his head, called upon Apollo to
appear.</p>

<p>To the surprise and dismay of all, the god of
music suddenly stood before them, beautiful as the
dawn and glowing with divine wrath. Though Pan
was himself a deity, he had no desire to challenge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Apollo, and looked fearfully at the sun-god's
angry frown; but the king, drunk with pride, commanded
him to play, and bade the god of music
surpass the playing if he could. There was, of
course, no question as to which was the better
musician, and the guests loudly proclaimed Apollo
the victor. One story tells that to prove further
the superiority of Apollo's playing the company
went to the old mountain-god Tmolus, and let him
make the final decision. Tmolus had to clear the
trees from his ears to listen; and having done this
he bent his head, and all his trees leaned with him.
He heard with delight both musicians play; and
when the last soft notes fell from Apollo's lyre,
the mountain-god awarded him the victory. But
Midas at the beginning of the contest had demanded
the right to decide on the merits of the
players, and he would not accept this verdict. In
his mad perversity and fondness for his favorite, he
cried out that Pan was the better player, and would
therefore be awarded the prize. Angered at this
unfair decision, Apollo left the banquet-hall, but
not before he had assured Midas that the injustice
would be punished.</p>

<p>These words came true in a most unexpected
way, for when the king looked into his mirror the
next morning, he found a pair of large fuzzy ass's
ears growing in the place of his own natural ones.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
Horrified at his absurd appearance, Midas did not
dare show himself to his people; but sent in haste
for a barber, and bade him make a wig large enough
to cover the monstrous ears. For many hours the
barber was closeted with the king, and when the
wig was finished, he was allowed to leave the palace,
after having sworn never to reveal the king's misfortune
under pain of death. For some time the
secret was safely kept; but the poor barber found
life unbearable, since he lived in constant fear of
letting out the truth about the king's ears in spite
of his frantic efforts to be silent. Whenever Midas
appeared in the city streets, the barber had to rush
home and shut himself up lest he should scream
out the story of the wig.</p>

<p>One day he thought of a happy solution of his
difficulty and one that broke his long seal of silence
without endangering his life. He went out into
the fields, dug a deep hole, and putting his head
down as far as he could he <span class="locked">shouted:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"King Midas has ass's ears, King Midas has
ass's ears."</p>

<p>Then he went home again, much happier for having
told some one of his secret, even though it was
only Mother Earth. But the truth once told did
not stay hidden even in the earth; for in time the
hole was filled again and reeds grew over the spot,
and as the wind swayed them back and forth they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
murmured: "King Midas has ass's ears. King
Midas has ass's ears."</p>

<p>It was not long before all the people in the
countryside had gathered to hear the strange whispering
of the reeds, and then the secret could be
kept no longer. But though every one knew the
truth King Midas continued to wear his wig, and
no one ever saw the real size of his ears.</p>

<span class="subhead">The Love of Apollo</span></h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">Like</span> his father, Jupiter, the young Apollo
was not content to stay always in the shining
halls of Olympus, but spent many days
wandering over the broad lands of Greece in search
of adventure, or for the sake of some maiden's love.
There were many fair ones among the daughters of
men, and they were wont to look with favor upon
the beautiful young god who came down from the
high heavens to woo them. Each morning as he
drove across the sky the fiery horses that were harnessed
to the chariot of the sun, some maiden gazed
with longing at the splendor above her, and prayed
that the radiant Apollo might look kindly upon her.
Seldom did these prayers go unanswered; but sometimes
the heart of the god was untouched by the devotion
so freely offered, and the maiden pined away
over her hopeless love.</p>

<p>Such a one was <span class="locked">Clytie,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span> who worshiped the glorious
sun-god, and longed in secret for his love;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
but in spite of her tears and sighing she met with
only coldness in return. Each day she rose before
the dawn to greet Apollo as soon as his chariot appeared
in the heavens, and all day long she watched
him until the last rays of light were lost behind the
hills. But the young god felt no sympathy for her
sorrow, and the unhappy Clytie grew so pale and
sick with longing that Jupiter in pity changed her
into a sunflower, that she might always stand watching
the course of the sun, and turn her face forever
toward him, no matter where his beams might shine.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The great beauty of <span class="locked">Apollo<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span> usually assured his
success whenever he stooped from his high estate to
love the maidens of the earth; but once he was repaid
for his hard-heartedness to poor Clytie, and
failed in his wooing when he sought the love of the
beautiful wood-nymph Daphne. He was wandering
one day in the forest when he came suddenly
upon Daphne as she was gathering flowers, and
her beauty and grace so charmed him that he desired
her love above everything else in the world.
Not wishing to frighten her, he stood still and
softly spoke her name. When the nymph heard
his voice, she turned quickly and looked at him
with the startled eyes of some wild forest-creature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
Surprise and fear held her for a moment while
Apollo spoke again gently and begged her not to
be afraid, for he was no hunter nor even a rude
shepherd. But Daphne only shrank away, fearful
of his eagerness; and when Apollo grew bolder and
ventured to draw near, she turned and fled through
the forest. Angered at this rebuff, the god followed
her, and though the nymph ran swiftly she
could not escape from her pursuer, who was now
more than ever determined to win her.</p>

<div id="ip_46" class="figcenter" style="width: 421px;"><img src="images/i046.jpg" width="421" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">Apollo and Daphne</div></div>

<p>In and out among the trees she darted, hoping
to bewilder him into giving up the chase; but
Apollo kept close behind, and little by little gained
on her flying feet. Wearied but unyielding,
Daphne now hurried her steps toward the stream
at the edge of the forest, where she knew that she
would find her father, the river-god Peneus. As
she neared the stream she cried aloud to him for
help; and just as Apollo had reached her side and
his outstretched hand was on her shoulder, a rough
bark began to enclose her soft body in its protecting
sheath; green branches sprouted from the ends
of her uplifted arms; and her floating hair became
only waving leaves under the grasp of the god's
eager fingers. Apollo stood dismayed at this
transformation, and when he saw a laurel tree
rooted in the spot where, but a moment ago, had
stood a beautiful living maiden, he repented of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
folly in having pursued her and sat for many days
beside the river, mourning her loss.</p>

<p>Thus it was that the laurel became the favorite
tree of Apollo; and when the god returned sadly to
Olympus, he decreed that whenever poet or musician
or any victor in the games was to be crowned
with a garland of leaves, those leaves were to be
taken from the laurel tree in memory of Daphne.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>In one of the flower-filled meadows of sunny
Greece, there played all day a golden-haired boy
named Phaëton,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> who was the pride and delight of
his mother Clymene, a stately maiden whom Apollo
had once wooed and won. The boy was willful and
headstrong, but beautiful as a young god; and his
mother, in her foolish pride, often reminded him
how favored he was above all other children in being
the son of Apollo. Each morning she led him to a
place where he could see the sun rise, and told him
that his father was just then harnessing the fiery
steeds to his golden-wheeled car, and would soon be
leaving his palace of burnished gold to drive across
the heavens, bringing daylight to the darkened earth.
She told him of Apollo's great beauty, and of his
wonderful music, and of his high position among the
gods, because his chariot was nothing less than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
glorious sun. Phaëton never tired of hearing these
stories, and it was no wonder that he became very
proud of his divine parentage, and boasted of it
among his playmates. The children only laughed
at his wonderful tales, and to convince them he
grew more arrogant in his bearing, until they, angered
by his continued boasts, bade him give some
proof of his claims or else be silent. This Phaëton
could not do; so they taunted him with his godlike
appearance, and sneered at his pretensions until the
boy, roused to action by their repeated insults, ran
to his mother, and begged her to tell him whether
he might not speak to his wonderful, but unknown
father, and obtain from him some proof to silence
the children's tongues.</p>

<p>Clymene hesitated to send the child on the long
necessary journey, but yielding at last to his entreaties,
she showed him the way to his father's palace.
It was night when Phaëton set out, and he
was obliged to travel quickly if he wished to reach
his journey's end before the sun-car left the golden
portals of the east. The palace of the sun was
marvelously wrought, and the light from its golden
columns and glittering jeweled towers so dazzled
the eyes of Phaëton that he was afraid to draw near.
But remembering the taunts of his playmates, he
grew bolder, and sought out his father to beg the
boon for which he had traveled so far and wearily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
When Apollo, from his ivory throne, saw the boy
approaching, he welcomed him kindly and called
him by the name of son. Hearing this, Phaëton
lost all fear, and told his father how the children had
refused to believe Clymene's stories, and had taunted
him because he could not prove the truth of his
mother's claim.</p>

<p>The lofty brow of Apollo grew cloudy as he listened
to Phaëton's words, and he promised to give
the boy the proof he desired by granting him any
favor he might ask. Instantly Phaëton demanded
that he be allowed that very day to drive the sun-chariot;
for when those on the earth saw him in
that exalted place, they could no longer refuse to
believe that he was indeed the favored child of
Apollo. Dismayed at this unexpected request, the
sun-god sought to persuade Phaëton to ask some
other boon, for he knew that no hand but his own
could guide the four winged horses that were harnessed
to the golden sun-car. But the boy was determined
to carry out his plan; and with all the
willfulness of a conceited child, he refused to heed
his father's warnings. As Apollo had sworn by the
river Styx&mdash;the most terrible of all oaths&mdash;to grant
Phaëton's request whatever it might be, he was
obliged to fulfill his promise; and very reluctantly
he led the boy to the portals of the palace, where the
impatient horses already stood pawing the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
Phaëton gazed at the sun-car in delight, for it was
all of gold&mdash;except the spokes of the wheel, which
were of silver&mdash;and the body of the chariot was
studded with chrysolites and diamonds that reflected
the sun's dazzling brightness. The impatient
boy sprang into the chariot and seized the
reins in his hands, while his father bound on his
head the blazing sun rays; but before the journey
was begun, Apollo poured over him a cooling essence,
that his skin might not be shriveled by the
burning heat of the sun, and gave him careful instructions
how to handle the restless steeds. Phaëton
but half listened to these words, and fretted to be off
on his triumphant course; so Apollo ordered the
gates to be thrown open, and the sun-car dashed
out into the heavens.</p>

<p>For a while all went well, for the boy remembered
his father's caution about using a whip on
the fiery horses; but as the day wore on he became
reckless, and forgot everything but his own proud
triumph. Faster and faster he drove, flourishing
his whip, and never heeding in what direction the
maddened horses sped. Soon he lost his way and
the chariot came so close to the earth that its fierce
heat dried up the rivers and scorched the ground and
shriveled up all vegetation, even turning the natives
in that part of the country brown,&mdash;which color
they are still to this very day. Smoke rose up from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
the charred and blackened earth, and it so clouded
the eyes of the now terrified Phaëton that he could
not find his way back to the path of the sun and
drove wildly far away from the earth. This caused
terrible disaster, for under the sudden cold all growing
things withered, and the blight of frost settled
over all the land.</p>

<p>Then a great cry arose from the people of the
earth when they saw their country laid waste; and
though Jupiter was fast asleep on his golden couch
he heard the cry, and started up in surprise. What
<i>could</i> be happening on the earth that the sound of
human wailing should break in upon the silence
of his dreams! One glance was sufficient for him
to see the smoke rising from the burnt-up land and
to realize the cause of all that useless destruction;
for far across the heavens&mdash;like a vanishing comet&mdash;Phaëton
was madly driving the flaming chariot
of the sun. Angered at the sight of a mere boy
presuming to take upon himself so great a task,
Jupiter seized one of his deadliest thunderbolts and
hurled it at the unhappy youth, whose scorched body
was immediately dashed from its lofty seat and sank
into the calm waters of the Eridanus River.</p>

<p>Clymene mourned her son's untimely death, and
gathered his remains from the river that they might
have honorable burial. Phaëton's dearest friend,
Cycnus, continued to haunt the river's edge, looking
for any relic of his favorite that might chance to rise
to the surface of the water. In recognition of this
devotion the gods changed him into a swan that
might stay forever on the river and plunge his head
fearlessly into the clear waters to search for some
scattered fragments of his unfortunate friend.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">During</span> the childhood of Apollo and Diana
the goddess Latona lived happily on the
island of Delos, and forgot all her early
misfortunes in the joy of her children. As they
grew up she boasted of their strength and beauty to
all who came to the shores of Delos, and no village
or hamlet&mdash;however small&mdash;but had heard of
Latona's children. When Grecian mothers put
their little ones to bed at night, they told wonderful
tales of an island far out at sea where a brother and
sister lived who were fairer than all the flowers in
the meadows; and maidens, sighing for a loveliness
greater than their own, wove garlands to adorn the
shrines of those two who walked the earth in all
their immortal grace.</p>

<p>Latona was proud of her children's fame, and
boasted of it far and wide. Few mothers cared to
dispute her claim, and these spoke only in whispers;
but there was one, bolder than the rest, who openly
laughed at the goddess's boast and taunted her with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
having but <i>two</i> such children whom she could
praise. This was Niobe, a Grecian princess and
the mother of fourteen children,&mdash;seven sons and
seven daughters,&mdash;all of them fair and strong and
godlike in spite of their mortal birth. When Niobe
learned that the people in her kingdom were loud
in their praises of Latona's children, and were neglecting
to honor her own splendid sons and daughters,
she was very angry and ordered all the statues
of Apollo and Diana to be destroyed; for the
people, in their devotion to beauty, had set up
many in the temples and the market place. Then
she bade a messenger go tell the goddess what had
been done, and show her in what contempt the
mother of fourteen children held her who had but
two.</p>

<p>When Latona received the message she was so
enraged at the insult that her desire for revenge
knew no bounds. She called Apollo and Diana to
her side and commanded them to go forth and slay
the children of Niobe. It was easy for Apollo to
accomplish his part of the cruel task, for he met the
seven sons of Niobe hunting, and slew them so
quickly that not one of the brothers had time to
ask what he had done to merit the god's wrath.
The daughters of Niobe were in the palace with
their mother; but this did not daunt the young
Diana, who put seven sharp arrows in her quiver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
and, bow in hand, went forth to complete Latona's
revenge. She found the maidens seated at Niobe's
side, weaving, and one by one the remorseless goddess
shot them down in spite of their mother's
heart-broken cries for mercy. Finding that her
entreaties were in vain, and seeing six of her daughters
lying dead beside her, the distracted Niobe
sought to shield the remaining one with her own
body while she prayed wildly to the gods to spare
her this one child. But the gods were deaf to her
cries, and Diana, fitting the last arrow to her bow,
shot the maiden as she cowered in her mother's arms.</p>

<p>Over her fallen body the wretched Niobe wept so
long that the gods at last felt pity for her grief, and
changed her into stone. This statue was placed by
a running stream, and ever afterward the waters were
fed by the tears that continued to course down the
cheeks of the stone image; and travelers came from
foreign lands to gaze on this marvel of a devoted
mother who could not cease from mourning for her
children even when turned into stone.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Though the goddess <span class="locked">Diana<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span> spent most of her
daylight hours in hunting, it was not often that she
exercised her skill to such cruel purpose as was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
shown in the case of poor Niobe. Wherever the
wild deer roamed, and the pathless forest knew no
touch of woodman's ax, there Diana, fleet-footed
and tireless, followed the chase. As soon as the
flaming chariot of the sun threw its first streak of
light across the hills, the goddess donned her short
tunic, and, armed with her golden bow and quiver,
set out with her band of nymphs for the day's hunt.
At noontide, wearied with the chase, she sought out
some secluded spot where the mountain stream ran
clear, and where the foliage hung round her like a
curtain.</p>

<div id="ip_56" class="figcenter" style="width: 404px;"><img src="images/i056.jpg" width="404" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">Diana of Versailles</div></div>

<p>On a certain day, when she and her maidens were
enjoying the refreshing coolness of the water, they
heard a slight rustle among the trees, and looking
around, perceived a young hunter watching them.
This was Actæon, who had himself been following
the deer since daybreak, and had been drawn to this
spot by the noise of running water. As he neared
the stream he heard sounds of girlish laughter, and
this so roused his curiosity that he hastily put aside
the branches to see who the merrymakers might be.
Great was his dismay when he recognized Diana and
her nymphs; but before he could disappear among
the bushes the goddess saw him, and catching up
some water in her hand, she threw it into his face,
crying: "Go now, if you can, and say that you have
seen Diana at her bath."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
The moment these words were spoken Actæon
felt a queer change coming over him, and he stared
in horror at his hands and feet, which were becoming
hoofs, and at his skin, which was rapidly changing
into a deer's hide. Antlers grew out of his head,
he dropped on all fours, and found himself turned
into a stag. Before he quite realized what had befallen
him he heard the baying of hounds, and knew
that his only safety was in flight. He dashed off
through the bushes, but the dogs were on his track.
Before he had gone far the pack had overtaken him,
since he knew no lore of the wild things by which
they elude their enemies, and were snapping and
snarling at his throat. Deprived of his human
voice he could not cry for help, and in a moment
the hounds had torn him into pieces. So was Diana
avenged.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>There was another young hunter who encountered
Diana and her maidens in the woods, but he met
with a kinder fate at the hands of the goddess than
did poor Actæon, whose only fault had been a most
natural curiosity.</p>

<p>The fleet-footed Diana was no more ardent in the
chase than was the hunter Orion, who roamed the
forest all day with his faithful dog, Sirius. One
morning, as he rushed eagerly through the woods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
in pursuit of a deer, he came suddenly upon the
seven Pleiades,&mdash;nymphs of Diana,&mdash;who were
resting after a long and arduous hunt begun at daybreak.
Charmed with their beauty, Orion drew
nearer, but the maidens, terrified at his outstretched
arms, fled away through the forest. Undaunted by
the remembrance of Actæon's fate, the hunter pursued
the flying nymphs, determined that so much
beauty should not escape him. Seeing that he was
gaining on them in spite of their swift feet, the
maidens called upon Diana for help, and were at
once changed into seven white pigeons which flew
up into the heavens before Orion's astonished eyes.
Sometime later these same Pleiades became seven
bright stars, and were set as a constellation in the
sky, where they have remained ever since.</p>

<p>Orion continued to hunt from early dawn until
nightfall without any misfortune overtaking him on
account of his impetuous love-making. On the
contrary his ardor evidently found favor with the
goddess Diana, for one day, when he unexpectedly
met her alone in the forest, she smiled graciously
upon him and offered to share the day's sport with
him. Perhaps it was the beauty of the young hunter
as well as his boldness that charmed the goddess;
but however that may be, she continued to meet
him in the forest, and they hunted together hour
after hour until the twilight began to fall. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
Diana knew that she must leave her lover and
mount her silver moon-car.</p>

<p>When Apollo learned of his sister's affection for
the young hunter, he was very angry, for Diana had
refused the love of the gods, and had begged of
Jupiter the right to live unwed. The sun-god determined
therefore to put an end to Orion's wooing.
So he waited at the shadowy portals of the west
until Diana, her nightly journey over, descended
from her silver car and threw the reins on the necks
of her wearied steeds. Then Apollo spoke to his
sister of her hunting, and praised her skill with the
bow. Presently he pointed to a tiny speck that was
rising and falling on the crest of the waves a long
distance away, and bidding her use this as a target,
he challenged her to prove her skill. Diana, suspecting
no treachery, fitted an arrow into her bow and
let it fly with unerring aim. Great was her distress
when she learned what her brother's trickery had led
her to do; for it was no floating log or bit of seaweed
that her arrow had pierced, but the body of
Orion. Apollo had seen the hunter go each morning
to the ocean to bathe, and he thought this an
easy way to dispose of the unworthy lover.</p>

<p>Diana mourned <span class="locked">Orion<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> many days; and to keep
his memory honored she placed him and his faithful
dog, Sirius, in the sky as constellations.</p>

<span class="subhead">The Story of Endymion</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> chaste Diana was not only a famous
huntress, but she was goddess of the moon
as well. By day she roamed the forest
with her band of nymphs, and by night she sailed
in her bright moon-car across the star-strewn sky,
and looked down at the sleeping earth lying in the
shadow except where her soft light fell. As soon
as Apollo had driven his tired, foam-flecked horses
within the western gates, and twilight had begun to
creep over the hills, Diana mounted her silver car
drawn by milk-white steeds, and started on her
nightly journey. During the first hours of her ride,
the friendly twilight kept a faint glow in the heavens,
and the road lay plain before her; but as night came
on and the blackness deepened, her horses might
have wandered from their accustomed path had not
the stars wakened from their day-dreaming and
come out in great luminous clusters to light the
goddess on her way. Though the journey was always
the same, night after night, Diana never wearied
of her course or found the sleeping earth less lovely,
as it unfolded hour by hour before her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
One evening as she looked down upon the quiet
scene, she saw the form of a shepherd-boy lying
upon a grassy hilltop, where the moonlight shone
full upon his upturned face. Diana was not susceptible
to love; but when she saw Endymion
sleeping, she marveled at his beauty, and felt a
strange longing to be near him. So she stepped
softly from her silver car and floated down to the
earth&mdash;to the spot where the unconscious shepherd
lay dreaming. There was perfect stillness all
around, and no whisper came but the soft murmur
from the pine-trees, which sounded like some great
creature sighing in its sleep. For some time the
goddess watched the youth in silence, then, stooping,
she gently kissed him. Endymion half wakened
at her touch, and looked sleepily around,
bewildered by the radiance that seemed to be enfolding
him in its unearthly light. But in a moment
the glory had faded away, and there was only the
deep blueness of the night all about him; for
Diana, frightened at her own boldness, had hurried
back to her silver car and had sped away into
the darkness. Endymion thought then that he had
dreamed a dream of some beautiful form that had
lingered by his side, and although he waited patiently
and hopefully all through the night, he saw
no other vision, and only the dawn came to greet
his weary eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
The next night Diana drove her milk-white
horses impatiently and often at random, until the
quiet stars, as they watched her restless course,
wondered and felt half afraid. When the clouds
wrapped her closely in their white embrace, the
goddess drove them angrily aside, lest they shut out
from her eyes the sight of the sleeping earth. At
last she drew near the hillside where Endymion lay,
and, on seeing him there, Diana glided again from
her silver car and stood beside his unconscious form.
At her light touch he stirred, and tried to rouse
himself from his heavy slumber; but some spell
seemed to bind his eyelids, and through sleep-dimmed
eyes he saw the radiance fade away. Night
after night he felt the presence of that bright being
whom his eyes so longed to behold; but only in
his dreams could he see her face or touch her floating
garments that passed by him like the rustle of
the night wind.</p>

<p>Each night Diana left her restless horses to stand
unwatched among the shifting clouds, while she
lingered on the earth to gaze upon the sleeping
shepherd-boy; and as she stood beside him she
wished that he might always be as now&mdash;ever
beautiful, ever young. So to keep him untouched
by sickness or sorrow or death she took him to
Mount Latmus, where there was a cave dedicated
in her honor which no mortal foot had ever profaned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
Here she placed Endymion, and caused an
eternal sleep to fall upon him, so that his body in
all its youth and beauty might never know decay.
And every night when her long journey was ended,
and the watchful stars had withdrawn their shining,
Diana hastened to the lonely cave on Mount Latmus,
there to linger beside <span class="locked">Endymion<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span> sleeping, and
touch him with a kiss that could not waken.</p>

<span class="subhead">Mercury</span></h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Mercury</span> was the son of Jupiter and Maia,
goddess of the plains, and from the day of
his birth he was a most remarkable infant,
even for a god. When scarcely a day old, he sprang
from his mother's arms, and ran some distance off
to where a tortoise shell was lying on the ground.
Picking this up, he bored holes in its side, stretched
strings across it, and began to play. Thus it was
that the first lyre was made.</p>

<div id="ip_64" class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;"><img src="images/i064.jpg" width="430" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">Flying Mercury</div></div>

<p>Proud of this beginning to his day's adventures,
Mercury ran away again toward evening, when his
mother was asleep, and roamed about the fragrant
meadows where Apollo kept his herd of cattle. The
pasturage was rich and the oxen were fat, and the
mischievous young god&mdash;only a day old&mdash;decided
to have some of them for his dinner. He took fifty
of the herd and tied branches of leaves to their
feet&mdash;so that their hoofs might leave no print on
the smooth turf&mdash;and drove them to a quiet spot
far away from the meadow. Here he killed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
ate two of the oxen, and kept the rest in hiding for
another day's feast. Then he hurried back to his
mother who had not yet wakened.</p>

<p>When Apollo found late that evening that fifty of
his cattle were gone, he searched but could not find
them. As he was about to give them up as lost, he
remembered that a son had been lately born to
Jupiter, whom that divine ruler had appointed to be
the god of thieves. Suspecting that his stolen oxen
were in the hands of this master-thief, Apollo hastened
to where Maia and the babe were sleeping.
Rousing the child angrily, the irate god accused
him of the theft; but Mercury protested his innocence,
and asked, "How could an infant but a day
old ever do such an unheard-of thing?" Apollo
was unconvinced, however, by this appearance of candor,
and feeling sure of the boy's guilt, dragged him
off to Olympus, where Mercury found it impossible
to pretend any longer that he knew nothing of
the missing oxen. He acknowledged his thieving,
showed Apollo the hiding place of the stolen cattle,
and in return for those that he had eaten gave the
sun-god his wonderful new lyre. This gift so delighted
Apollo that he presented the day-old prince
of thieves with a magic wand, which, when held between
any who were quarreling, would cause all
anger and strife to cease. To test the value of the
wand Mercury thrust it between two snakes which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
were struggling over the possession of a wounded
bird; and immediately they twined themselves around
the staff, and remained coiled together in perfect
friendliness. This pleased Mercury so much that
he bade them stay there forever as long as the wand
should <span class="locked">last.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span></p>

<p>There were two other valuable gifts that the gods
gave the young Mercury,&mdash;a winged cap and a pair
of winged sandals,&mdash;so that, as the messenger of the
gods, he might be fleet of foot on his many errands
to and from Olympus.</p>

</div>

<p>Among the varied duties assigned to Mercury was
that of conducting the souls of the dead to Hades;
but this did not occupy all the god's time, and he
still had many hours in which to go on other missions.
In spite of his rather doubtful reputation
for honesty, the gods often sought his assistance in
their difficulties; and in one very delicate commission
he proved himself a competent ally. This was when
Jupiter went wooing the maiden Io.</p>

<p>The jealous and vengeful Juno was always on the
watch whenever her lord took a fancy to go wandering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
about the earth; so to woo the gentle Io unseen
by his wife required some diplomacy on Jupiter's
part. Accordingly he spread a thick cloud over the
meadow where he was wont to meet the maiden, and
trusted that its appearance would not arouse Juno's
suspicions. He also took the precaution to visit Io
at the time when the watchful queen of heaven was
accustomed to sleep; but one day Juno awoke sooner
than usual, and finding Jupiter absent, she at once
surmised that he was adventuring again in some love-affair.
When she looked down at the earth, she saw
the thick cloud that hung over the meadow and
noticed that it never altered its position, no matter
how the winds blew. Feeling sure that this was
some trick intended to deceive her, the wrathful
goddess glided down to the earth and appeared at
the astonished Jupiter's side&mdash;but not before he
had had time to change Io into a heifer.</p>

<p>"Golden-sandaled" Juno walked about the
meadow gathering flowers, then she asked her husband
why he was lingering there, so far from bright
Olympus. Jupiter answered that he was amusing
himself by creating a heifer. This explanation did
not deceive Juno; but she pretended to be satisfied,
and praised the beautiful creature's glossy skin and
large soft eyes. Then she demanded it of Jupiter
as a gift, and the ruler of the gods, not knowing
how to refuse, consented. The triumphant goddess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
led away the heifer and put her in charge of Argus.
Now Argus had a hundred eyes, and though he
often went to sleep, some of his eyes always kept
awake; so Juno felt sure that no device of Jupiter's
could enable Io to escape from the watchful guardian
who never wholly slept.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jupiter was in despair over this unhappy
ending to his wooing, and sought the help
of Mercury, who often lent his ready wits to gods
and mortals in distress. Laying aside his cap and
sandals and snake-entwined wand, by which he
might easily be recognized, Mercury went down to
the earth in the disguise of a shepherd. With his
pipes in his hand he strolled through the country
until he came to the mountain-side, where Argus sat
watching the heifer; and when he began to play, the
music was so sweet that Argus begged him to stop
awhile that he might listen longer to the wonderful
playing. The wily god consented, and as he piped
on, some of the hundred eyes grew drowsy with
sleep, but some of them stayed open and watchful.</p>

<p>The droning of the pipes kept on, and to add to
the drowsiness of the music, Mercury began to tell
stories in a low sing-song tone that cast a kind of
spell over the eyes that were still watching. He
told of Apollo's affection for the youth <span class="locked">Hyacinthus,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span>
whom Zephyrus, god of the west wind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
also loved; and how, when the sun-god was playing
quoits with his friend, Zephyrus in a fit of jealous
anger blew aside the missile hurled by Apollo so
that it struck Hyacinthus and killed him. But the
sun-god would not let the fair youth be forgotten,
and changed each drop of his blood into delicate
white flowers which were forever to bear his <span class="locked">name.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span>
Then Mercury told of Æsculapius, son of Apollo
and Coronis, who was entrusted to the care of
Chiron,&mdash;most famous of the Centaurs,&mdash;and was
also taught by his divine parent the art of healing.
In this he became so skillful that he even restored
the dead to life, and so incurred the wrath of
Jupiter, who, fearing that Æsculapius<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> would receive
undue honor, killed him with a thunderbolt. To
these stories Mercury added many more that told of
the loves of the gods, and at last all the hundred
eyes of Argus were closed. Then Mercury, drawing
a sharp sword, cut off the great head as it
drooped forward, and rolled it down the rocks.</p>

<p>When Juno heard of the death of her faithful
servant she was terribly angry, and vowed that she
would bring punishment on those who had been the
cause of his slaying; but before doing this she commemorated
the fidelity of Argus by taking his hundred
eyes and putting them in the tail of her favorite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
bird, the peacock. Then she carried out her revenge
by sending an enormous gadfly to torment
poor Io, who was still in the form of a heifer.
From one country to another the unhappy creature
wandered; and once, in a desperate effort to escape
her tormentor, she plunged into the sea, which was
afterwards called Ionian in her honor. Across this
she swam and reached the shore of Africa; but even
here the gadfly followed her, and the vengeance of
Juno never allowed her a moment's rest. Jupiter
could do nothing to ease her sufferings by interceding
for her to the remorseless queen of heaven; but
at last Juno consented to send away the gadfly and
to restore Io to her own form if Jupiter would promise
never to visit her again. Reluctantly the ruler
of the gods agreed to this demand, and Io became
once more a beautiful maiden.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>When Jupiter went wandering on the earth in
search of adventures other than the wooing of some
maiden, he often made Mercury his companion, for
this slender young god was his favorite among all
the dwellers of Olympus. One day both the gods,
disguised as travelers, stopped at the hut of an aged
couple named Philemon and Baucis; and pretending
weariness, they asked to be allowed to rest.
The old couple were delighted that strangers had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
honored their humble roof, and in order to extend
the hospitality still further, Philemon decided to
kill the one thing he had that could furnish meat for
the guests. This was a large fat goose, who had no
mind to be killed and eaten, even to supply a meal
for gods; so when the old man tried to catch him,
he sought refuge between Jupiter's knees. When
the ruler of the gods learned that the couple intended
to sacrifice their one possession, he was
greatly touched by their kindness, but would not
allow them to kill the trusting bird that had fled to
him for protection.</p>

<p>Then the good wife Baucis set before her guests
olives, and cornel berries preserved in vinegar, and
cheese, with eggs cooked in the ashes. She laid
earthen cups and dishes on the table, which she had
already rubbed with sweet-smelling herbs, and placed
beside them an earthen pitcher full of their best
wine. While the simple meal was going on, and
the guests were partaking of a dessert of apples and
wild honey, Baucis was so fluttered over her duties
as hostess that she did not observe the pitcher; but
old Philemon looked on in astonishment at the
wine which renewed itself in the pitcher as fast as it
was poured out. He whispered to his wife to watch
this miracle; and when she, too, saw the never-empty
pitcher, she was filled with a vague terror,
and looked fearfully at the smiling strangers. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
Jupiter told the old man and his wife who their
guests really were, and bade them ask of him some
boon, swearing by the terrible river Styx to grant
whatever they might desire. Then Philemon and
Baucis begged that they might be allowed to serve
the gods as long as they lived; and that when their
time of service was over, they might die together.
Pleased with the simplicity of this request, Jupiter
gladly promised that all should be as they wished;
and he transformed their humble cottage into a
beautiful temple, where they might worship the gods
all their days. And when after years of faithful
service Philemon and Baucis died, Jupiter changed
them into lordly oaks, which stood before the pillars
of the temple as a monument to their fidelity.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">Once</span> the stately Juno looked down from
high-peaked Olympus and saw Jupiter
walking in a meadow with a maiden so exquisitely
fair that the flowers at her feet looked dull
and faded beside her dazzling whiteness. This was
Callisto, so famous for her beauty that suitors came
from distant lands to woo her; but she cared nothing
for their rich gifts, nor would she listen to any vows
of love. Then Jupiter sought her as she wandered
alone in the meadow; and the maiden gladly yielded
to the great ruler of the gods the love that no
mortal man had been able to win. When white-armed
Juno learned how many hours Jupiter spent
by the side of Callisto, she determined to punish the
helpless maiden, and accordingly turned her into a
bear. For a long time Jupiter sought her in the
familiar meadow, but she never came again to meet
him. Then one day he found her in the forest with
her little son Arcas&mdash;both turned into bears by the
jealous hate of Juno. Grieved as he was at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
misfortune, the ruler of Olympus could not restore
them to their human form; but he took them to
the heavens, that they might suffer no further harm,
and placed them in the sky as the constellations of
the Great and Little Bear.</p>

<p>Jupiter often assumed the form of a bird or animal
so as to escape Juno's watchful eyes. As a swan he
won the love of Leda, and their child was the fair-haired
Helen whose beauty cost the men of Troy
so dear. As a white bull he wooed the gentle maid
Europa, who was frightened at his sudden appearance
in the meadow where she was playing; but as soon
as she saw how tame the beautiful animal was and
how anxious to be petted, she lost all her fear. She
made a wreath of flowers to hang about his neck,
and grew so accustomed to her new playmate that
she got upon his back as he bent his lordly head to
receive her garlands. The bull then galloped
away toward the sea, and before the terrified
girl could realize what had happened he plunged
with her into the waves. As soon as they were far
from the land, the white bull spoke gently to Europa
and told her who he really was and how, for love of
her, he had assumed this strange disguise. So the
maiden was no longer afraid, but allowed herself to
be carried to an unknown land that was afterward
called Europe in her honor.</p>

<p>It was no wonder that Juno kept watch over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
earth as no other goddess needed to do, for she knew
that the loveliness that belonged to the daughters of
men could easily lure great Jupiter from his golden
throne. She was therefore very reasonably angry
when she looked one day through the white clouds
around Olympus and saw&mdash;not on the earth, but in
the lap of the ever-tossing sea&mdash;the most beautiful
being that could exist outside of a dream. So wonderfully
fair was this maiden upon whom Juno fixed
her resentful gaze, that she seemed too perfect to be
made of flesh and blood, and the jealous watcher was
almost persuaded that it was no real living thing
which rested softly on the crest of the waves, but
some creature made from the rainbow colors and
white mist of the sea. The ocean rocked her lightly
on its breast, and Zephyrus, the west wind, bore
her gently toward the shore. The sunlight shone
on her rosy flesh, and her long hair lay out upon
the waves, glistening like spun gold. The sky
above her was not more soft or deep than the
blueness of her eyes, and the smile upon her perfect
lips was of a subtle sweetness more alluring than the
breath of spring. As she lay pillowed in the arms of
the slow-swinging sea, the west wind bore her to the
island of Cyprus; and when her foot touched the
warm sand, the goddess rose from the waves, which
were so loth to yield her to the waiting earth,
and stepped lightly upon the shore. She flung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
the wet ringlets from her forehead, shook the foam
from her breast and shoulders&mdash;white as the purest
marble&mdash;and stood upright in the warm sunshine&mdash;the
most perfect thing that the wondering old earth
had ever looked upon. This was <span class="locked">Venus,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span> goddess
of love and beauty, born of the foam of the sea, and
destined to be the most far-famed of all the dwellers
in Olympus.</p>

<p>It was not long before others than the watchful
Juno had seen this vision of loveliness, and she was
eagerly welcomed by the gods as soon as she
appeared among them. The beauty and grace of
the new goddess so charmed them that all were
eager to yield her homage, and she was immediately
sought in marriage&mdash;even Jupiter himself becoming
an enamored suitor. But "laughter-loving" Venus
refused to be wed, and would not listen to any wooing.
Then the ruler of the gods, finding his
proffered love scorned by the proud goddess, determined
to punish her by compelling her to marry
Vulcan, the ugliest and most ill-favored of deities;
and as Jupiter's word was law in all the universe,
Venus was obliged to obey. But though married,
she was by no means a devoted or faithful wife, and
she caused poor Vulcan many unhappy moments;
for he saw how his misshapen form repelled her,
and he knew that she would soon seek for happiness
elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
The first to win the love of "golden" Venus was
Mars, the handsome god of war, who, though
delighted at being honored as the chosen one of
beauty, was careful that the goddess's preference
should not be known. When he and Venus met in
some lover's bower, they placed Alectryon&mdash;the
attendant of Mars&mdash;on guard, so that no one, not
even prying Juno, would come upon them unawares.
Things went on happily for some time; but one
day Alectryon fell asleep at his post, and slept so
soundly that he did not see Apollo, in his golden
chariot, driving close to the trysting place of the
lovers. When the sun-god realized what was happening,
he went straightway to Vulcan and told him
how much his wife was enjoying the society of Mars.</p>

<p>Vulcan, angry and ashamed, set to work to forge
a net of linked steel; and when it was finished, he
hurried with it to the spot where Venus and the god
of war were still conversing together. Stepping up
softly behind them, Vulcan drew the net over their
heads, and thus held them fast. Then he hastened
back to Olympus, where he told his story and bade
all the gods go look upon the ridiculous and humiliating
plight of the imprisoned lovers. When the
captured pair were at last set free, Mars rushed off
to find Alectryon and to learn why they had not
been warned of Apollo's approach. Finding his
sentinel peacefully sleeping, unmindful of the disaster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
that had occurred through his neglect of duty, Mars
was so enraged that he changed Alectryon into a
cock, and commanded him to rise early every morning
and crow to announce the coming of the sun.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The next fancy of Venus was for <span class="locked">Adonis,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span> a handsome
young hunter, who was so fearless in his
pursuit of game that the goddess often felt anxious
for his safety. She urged him to give up the chase
and spend all his day with her; but however much
Adonis enjoyed the society of Venus, he also loved
to roam the forests, and no entreaties could induce
him to give up his favorite sport. One day Adonis
was following a wild boar, and believing that the
creature was wounded, he boldly drew near, when
the boar turned suddenly upon him and drove his
long tusks into the youth's side. As he lay dying
in the forest, Venus heard of the tragic ending of
the day's hunt and hurried to save him. So careless
was she of her own hurt that she rushed heedlessly
through the rough briers, which tore her soft skin
and scattered drops of blood on the white wood
flowers. When she reached Adonis, he was already
past her help and could not respond to her caresses.
Holding his lifeless body in her arms, Venus wept
and mourned for her beloved; and her tears, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
fell upon the sympathizing earth, were changed into
anemones. Then to hide from her eyes the painful
sight of the young hunter's mangled body, the
kindly earth again took pity on her grief and turned
the drops of blood that came from Adonis's side
into red roses. Still the goddess would not be
comforted, but sat mourning alone with her dead.</p>

<p>Then Mercury came to lead the soul of Adonis
to gloomy Hades; and when the messenger of the
gods had departed with his slight burden, Venus
went back to Olympus, and throwing herself on the
ground before Jupiter's throne, she besought him to
give Adonis back to her, or else to allow her to stay
with him in Hades. Since the world could not well
spare the goddess of beauty, Jupiter refused to let
her go to the sunless realm of Pluto; but neither
would that dread ruler consent to give up Adonis
to her longing arms. Then the gods, touched by
the depth of Venus's grief, interceded in her behalf,
and reluctantly Pluto agreed to allow Adonis to
spend six months with the goddess in the warmth
and joy of the sunlight if for the rest of the year he
would be content to dwell in Hades.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Another of the fortunate ones who gained the
love of Venus was Anchises, prince of Troy; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
though the goddess lavished much affection upon
him, she was rather ashamed of her attachment,
for Anchises was of only mortal birth. She therefore
bade him to keep the matter secret, and for a
time Anchises obeyed; but being proud of his relation
to the goddess he forgot her instructions,
and boasted of his good fortune. This so angered
the willful Venus that she never bestowed her
favors on him again; but transferred all her affection
to her son Æneas, who fared better at her hands
than his father Anchises. In the many adventures
that befell this famous hero, Venus was always a
ready protectress, and whenever Æneas was involved
in some apparently hopeless situation, his goddess
mother would immediately hide him in a thick mist
which was sure to baffle his enemies. Sometimes,
as in the Trojan war, she wrapped him in her shining
robe and bore him from the battle-field; and
if the hero <i>was</i> constantly in tears, as the poet
Virgil says, it was certainly not the fault of Venus.</p>

<p>As to the ultimate fate of Anchises, some authorities
say that the offended goddess borrowed one of
Jupiter's thunderbolts and disposed of her talkative
lover in this fashion; but the most probable story
is that he lived to see Æneas become a famous prince
of Troy, and was himself carried from the ruins of
that burning city on the shoulders of his devoted
son.</p>

<span class="subhead">The Story of Cupid and Psyche</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Cupid</span>,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> god of love, was the son of Mars and
Venus; and though he was always the happiest
of children, his mother was distressed because
he never grew up, but remained year after year a chubby,
dimpled child. When she consulted Themis, the
goddess of Justice, to find out why Cupid was never
any older, she was told that "Love cannot grow
without Passion." This explanation was at first
very mystifying; but later, when Anteros was born,
Venus understood the meaning of the strange words.
Cupid then developed into a tall slender youth who
did not revert to his childish form except in his
brother's absence, when he again became a rosy, mischievous
child. Though grown larger in stature, the
god of love still kept his gauzy wings, and always
carried a bow and a quiver full of arrows. No
mortal ever saw him, though many knew when he
had come and gone; but should any one be touched
by a shaft sent carelessly from Cupid's golden bow,
he was henceforth a slave to the slender winged god<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
who bore lightly in his hand so much of human
happiness and misery.</p>

<p>There was once a king who had three daughters
whose beauty was famed far and wide; but the loveliness
of the youngest was so great that people called
her the goddess of Beauty and worshiped her with
offerings of flowers. The maiden, Psyche, was
troubled over all this adoration, and begged her followers
to cease from their mad worship; for she
knew that Venus would be sure to punish the one
who usurped her title and received the homage due
only to an immortal. The people continued, however,
to call Psyche the goddess of beauty; and
when Venus saw her own temple forsaken and her
shrines ungarlanded, she was so incensed at the
insult that she vowed to punish poor Psyche, who
had been a most unwilling object of all this mistaken
devotion. The goddess summoned her son Cupid
to her presence and bade him go slay the maiden
who had presumed to be her rival in beauty.</p>

<p>Believing that his mother's anger was justified,
Cupid was quite willing to kill the offending mortal
with one of his poisoned arrows; and accordingly
he went in search of Psyche, whom he found asleep
in one of the rooms of her father's palace. It was
night, and the moonlight shone through the open
window, falling softly upon the couch where the
maiden, unconscious of her doom, lay sleeping.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
One bright beam had lightly touched her forehead
just as Cupid entered, and he saw with delight the
loveliness that his mother had been eager to destroy.
As he leaned nearer to the sleeping maiden one of
his own arrows grazed his side, and all unknowingly
he was wounded. Not wishing to harm the beauty
that he was now beginning to love, Cupid softly
left the room and went back to Olympus.</p>

<p>When Venus found that her rival was not dead, and
that Cupid refused to hurt a thing so fair, she began
to persecute poor Psyche until life grew unbearable
for the helpless maiden, and she determined to kill
herself. So she stole secretly from the palace and
climbed up a high mountain, where there was a
ledge of rock overhanging a steep cliff. It was
rather fearful to look down into the valley from the
rocky ledge, and for a moment Psyche's heart failed
her; but then she remembered the daily annoyances
that Venus inflicted upon her, and she remembered
also the words of the oracle which said that her
future husband was to be "no mortal, but a monster
whom neither gods nor men can resist." So, summoning
all her courage, she threw herself over the
cliff, expecting to be dashed to pieces upon the rocks
below. But Cupid had been watching over her,
ever since she began her weary journey up the mountain;
and when he realized what she meant to do,
he commanded Zephyrus to keep very near and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
catch her lightly when she fell. So it was not upon
the cruel rocks that Psyche's soft body lay, but in
the friendly arms of the west wind who bore her
to a distant island, where Cupid had already made
preparations for her coming.</p>

<div id="ip_84" class="figcenter" style="width: 439px;"><img src="images/i084.jpg" width="439" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">Psyche</div></div>

<p>On the thick grass in the midst of a beautiful
garden, Zephyrus laid his slight burden; and when
Psyche opened her eyes, she found herself unhurt,
though bewildered by her strange journey through
the air and by its unexpected ending. She rose from
the grass and began to wander about the garden,
wondering where she might be and what land lay
beyond the blue water whose waves rolled lazily
upon the beach that stretched away for miles at
the foot of the garden. Then she strolled further
inland among the flowers, and soon came to a beautiful
palace whose doors were opened wide as if to
welcome her. Timidly she entered the stately hall,
and saw before her a richly-laden table and a chair
placed in readiness for the coming guest. Soon she
heard voices speaking to her gently, and they bade
her eat and drink, for the feast was spread in her
honor. Seeing no one, but reassured by the kindly
voices, she ate of the food so generously provided.
Then she went again into the garden, but left it soon
and hurried down to the sea; for when evening
came on, she began to be lonely, and the silence of
the garden grew oppressive. On the beach she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
heard the sound of lapping water and felt herself a
part of the life that beats forever in the restless
changing sea.</p>

<p>At night she sought the palace where the unseen
servitors again ministered to her wants; and in the
darkness, Cupid came to woo her. He did not
reveal his name, but he told how he had rescued
her from death and brought her to this island,
that she might never again be persecuted by jealous
Venus. Everything that she wished for would be
hers for the mere asking, and the invisible attendants
would always be on hand to do her bidding. He
himself would ever be her loyal lover; and would
come each night to cheer her solitude. The only
thing that he asked in return was that she should
never seek to know his name or try to see his face.
Psyche listened to the words of Cupid, and was
won by the soft pleading of his voice. She was
content to stay on the unknown island, and to be
with her unseen lover, whose name and face must
remain forever a mystery. Many happy weeks
passed, and Psyche never wished to leave her new
home, for though she was often lonely as she walked
each day in the rose-garden, she forgot the long
hours of solitude when Cupid came at night to
gladden her with his love and to tell her of his
wanderings.</p>

<p>As time went on Psyche began to wonder how
things were faring at her father's palace; and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
wished very much to see her sisters who must have
long since believed her dead. Cupid had told her
she might ask for anything that she wished save
the two forbidden things, so she summoned the
west wind and bade him bring her sisters to her.
Zephyrus gladly obeyed, and soon Psyche saw her
two sisters standing beside her, more astonished than
she to find themselves there. For hours they talked
together, and Psyche told them of her adventure
on the mountain and how she had been rescued by
the friendly west wind. She told them of her
mysterious lover, of his riches and his great kindness,
and regretted that she could not describe his
appearance; but, she explained, this was impossible
since she herself had never seen him. As the sisters
listened to Psyche's story, their hearts were filled
with bitter envy that she should be thus favored
above all other maidens; and they planned to rob
her of her happiness. They reminded her of the
words of the oracle that she should marry a monster;
and under the pretense of a loving interest in her
welfare, they urged her to break her promise to her
lover and to find out whether he was in truth a
monster that was only waiting his time to devour
her. Psyche at first scorned these malicious suggestions,
but by and by they began to make an impression
on her troubled mind, and she found herself
ready to listen and to believe. Finally she agreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
to carry out the plan that her sisters arranged, which
was to secrete a sharp knife in her room and use it
to kill the monster as he slept.</p>

<p>When Zephyrus had taken the sisters back to
their own home, and Psyche was once more alone,
she felt ashamed of the promise that she had made
them; but at the same time she could not forget
the words of the oracle nor cast off the suspicions
that now filled her mind. She was anxious, too, to
see her lover's face and to be able to confront her
sisters with the truth when they should taunt her
again. So that night when Cupid was fast asleep,
she rose softly, and by the light of a tiny lamp which
she noiselessly lit, she groped for the knife with
which she intended to slay the creature who&mdash;her
sisters assured her&mdash;was so frightful that he
dared not show his face. Cautiously she stepped
to Cupid's side, and held over him the flickering
lamp; but how astonished she was to behold&mdash;not
an ugly monster as she had expected&mdash;but a slender
youth whose beauty was so great that she felt her
heart beat fast with joy. Breathless she gazed at
the unconscious form, and dared not move for fear
of waking him; but as she bent adoringly over him
a drop of oil fell from her lamp on Cupid's shoulder,
and he awoke.</p>

<p>For a moment he stared with startled eyes at the
knife and the lamp held in her trembling hands;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
then he understood the meaning of it all, and his
beautiful face grew sad. In a voice full of pity he
spoke to the now remorseful Psyche, and told her
that, as she had broken her promise, he must go
away from her and never come again. In vain Psyche
wept and begged him to forgive her rash deed, confessing
that it was her sisters who had tempted her
to betray her trust. But Cupid gently freed himself
from her clinging arms, and spreading his gauzy
wings flew out into the night. Psyche, still weeping,
went down into the garden, hoping that Love might
relent and return in spite of his parting words; but
as the hours passed she was still waiting alone, and
when the morning came it found her fast asleep, lying
wet-eyed among the dew-laden flowers.</p>

<p>When at last Psyche awoke, it was midday; and
looking around she found to her surprise that she
was in a deep valley with mountains on all sides,
and that the palace with its rose-garden had vanished.
All day she wandered in the valley, meeting
no one who might direct her to her home; and
when at length she came to a stately marble temple,
she was glad to enter it and rest. Though she did
not know to whom the temple was dedicated, Psyche
prayed to the gods for help; and Ceres, at whose
altar she was kneeling, heard her, and in pity answered
her prayers. She told the disheartened
maiden that her lover was no other than Cupid, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
god of Love, "whom neither gods nor man can resist,"
and that if she wished to gain favor in the
eyes of his mother,&mdash;and thereby win her lover
back,&mdash;she would do well to seek the temple of
Venus and offer her services to the offended goddess.</p>

<p>Psyche listened to these friendly words, and
thanked Ceres for taking pity on her suffering.
When she left the temple she walked many miles
through the valley, until she came to a shrine on
which were hung flowers, fruit, and jewels, which the
suppliants of Venus had brought as votive offerings.
Before this shrine Psyche knelt very humbly, and
implored the goddess of Beauty to accept her service
and set her some task by which she could prove
her fidelity. Venus was still angry at the memory
of Psyche's former honors, and she was not to be
placated by any prayers, however sincere. She accepted
the maiden's service, but determined to torment
her by setting impossible tasks.</p>

<p>She brought Psyche into a granary, where there
were thousands of different kinds of seeds all thrown
in bewildering and unsorted heaps. Pointing to these,
the goddess bade her separate them all, and pile
them together so that by nightfall each seed should
be in its proper place. Poor Psyche was in despair
at ever being able to tell one kind of seed from
another; but Cupid, hearing her sighs, sent an
army of ants who worked silently and swiftly at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
enormous heap of seeds, and before twilight came
the work was done.</p>

<div id="ip_90" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/i090.jpg" width="600" height="397" alt="" /><div class="caption">Charon and Psyche</div></div>

<p>When Venus saw this almost impossible task
accomplished, she knew that Psyche had never done
the work unaided; so reproving her angrily for her
incompetence, she gave the maiden another commission,
which was to gather some golden fleece from
the sheep that were browsing in a meadow not far
from Venus's shrine. Next morning Psyche set
about her task, but as she neared the river that must
be crossed before she could reach the meadow, the
kindly reeds on the water's edge spoke to her, and
warned her of the danger of her undertaking. They
told her that the rams in the flock were so fierce
that they would surely destroy her if she ventured at
this hour among them; but that if she waited until
noontide, when they grew drowsy and lay down on
the grass beside the river, then she could cross in
safety, and gather the bits of golden fleece which she
would find caught on the bushes. Psyche listened
gratefully to this advice; and when the sun was
high overhead, and the panting sheep were gathered
by the river, lulled to sleep by the drowsy murmur
of the reeds, she crossed the water fearlessly, and
gathered an armful of golden fleece from the bushes
among which the flock had wandered. That night
she delivered her precious burden to Venus, who
again reproved her angrily, knowing well that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
was through Cupid's intervention that she had escaped
the dangerous rams.</p>

<p>Then the goddess gave her a third errand, and
bade her go down to gruesome Hades to beg of
Proserpina, Pluto's queen, a box of her magic ointment,
which could restore all fading beauty to its
former perfection. In the early morning Psyche
set out on her journey, fearful of the dangers that
lurked by the way, but eager to gain the favor of her
hard-hearted mistress, so that she might thereby win
her lover back. When she had walked many hours,
not knowing where to find the entrance to remote
and unsought Hades, a voice whispered softly in her
ear, telling her of a certain cave through which she
might enter the dreaded region of the dead. Then
the voice directed her how to go unharmed past
Cerberus, the three-headed dog, and how to persuade
Charon, the silent ferryman, to row her across the
black and swiftly-flowing river. Encouraged by this
timely help, Psyche was able to secure the desired
box, and to come safely out of that dark country
from which only the gods are privileged to return.</p>

<p>As she trod wearily up the valley back to the
shrine of Venus, it occurred to her to take a little of
the magic ointment for herself, for she knew that
these days of waiting and working had dimmed the
beauty that once charmed Cupid's eyes. So she
opened the box and out sprang the invincible Spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
of Sleep, who seized upon poor unresisting Psyche
and laid her, apparently lifeless, by the roadside.
But Cupid was watching over his beloved through
all the stages of her journey; and when he saw her
unconscious on the ground, he flew quickly to her
assistance, and fought with the masterful Spirit of
Sleep until he conquered it, and compelled it to
return to the box from which it had been set free.
Then he roused Psyche from her sudden sleep and
told her that her troubles were at an end, for henceforth
he would always stay beside her. Together
they went up to bright Olympus and stood before
Jupiter's throne, where Cupid besought the
gods to look with favor upon their love and to
grant to Psyche the gift of immortal life. To this
great Jupiter gladly consented; and Venus, who was
now ready to forgive her one-time rival, welcomed
her as the fitting wife of Cupid,&mdash;for Psyche is but
another name for Soul, and the Soul, to find its true
happiness, must dwell forever with <span class="locked">Love.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span></p>

<span class="subhead">Famous Lovers</span></h2>

<h3 id="echo">I. Echo and Narcissus</h3>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">Echo</span> was a wood-nymph and a follower of
Diana; and she had the one fault of wanting
to talk all the time, especially if she found
some one who was willing to listen. One day Juno
went down in great haste to the earth, suspecting
that Jupiter was spending too much time in the
society of the nymphs; but before she had gone
very far into the forest she met Echo and stopped
to speak to her. Now Echo knew that the ruler of
the gods was happily engaged with the nymphs,
and would not be pleased at his wife's sudden appearance;
so she began to talk rapidly to Juno, and
to tell her such entertaining stories that the unsuspicious
goddess waited to listen. While Echo was
thus keeping the jealous queen from seeking for her
husband, Jupiter&mdash;warned of her coming&mdash;left the
nymphs and returned in haste to Olympus. When,
later on, Juno learned that Echo had intentionally
kept her listening so that Jupiter could make his
retreat unseen, she was so angry with the officious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
nymph that she forbade her ever to speak again,
except to repeat the last word of any conversation
she might hear. Thus she could never more tell
beguiling stories, or interfere in behalf of Jupiter.</p>

<p>At first Echo was very miserable over this misfortune;
but in spite of it she managed to spend
her time happily in the forest, and to hunt with the
other nymphs of Diana. One evening as she
stopped at a brookside to drink, she met a handsome
youth named Narcissus, and at once fell in love
with him; but unfortunately she could not tell him
of her affection except by languishing looks and
sighs. Narcissus was not at all pleased by her evident
interest in him, for many maidens had loved
him, and he had turned coldly from their advances,
preferring to roam the forest alone. Sometime
later Narcissus was hunting with a companion, and,
having rushed away in pursuit of a stag, he found
that his friend was no longer in sight. He called
to him, but no one answered except the devoted
Echo who was always dogging his footsteps. When
Narcissus called "Are you here?" Echo replied,
"Here." "Come!" cried the youth, and Echo
answered, "Come." Then she appeared before the
young hunter and mutely begged for his love; but
Narcissus scornfully turned from her, exclaiming,
"You shall never have me." "Have me," cried
the unhappy maiden; but her frank offer was repulsed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
and the hard-hearted youth turned away.
Echo made no further attempt to win his love, but
went into the mountains to live out her sad life
alone. No one ever saw her again, and in time she
pined away and died; but her voice remained to
whisper among the hills, and to give back the last
word to any one who sought to call her.</p>

<p>As for Narcissus, his scorn of love brought its
just punishment, for Venus decreed that he should
suffer even as poor Echo had done. One day when
he was hunting in a remote part of the forest, he
came upon a beautiful deep pool in which all objects
were reflected as clearly as in a mirror. No
wild things had ever come to drink of the cool stream;
no feet of beasts had ever trampled the grass on its
margin or muddied its pure waters; not even a
floating leaf had ruffled its calm surface.</p>

<p>When Narcissus knelt on the lush grass at the
pool's edge and looked down into the clear water,
he was surprised to see a beautiful face gazing up
at him from the depth of the pool. He leaned
nearer, and the face did not withdraw, but seemed
to approach his own. Then he put out his arms
to the water-nymph who, he believed, was returning
his advances, and he was delighted to see two
white arms stretched out as if to clasp him in
their embrace. But as soon as he attempted to
grasp them, there was only the cool water in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
hands, and the nymph had vanished. When the
surface of the pool had grown clear again, and Narcissus
leaned anxiously over it to see what had become
of this baffling maiden, there she was still,
gazing at him with her beautiful eyes. Again and
again Narcissus strove to embrace her, but she
eluded his eager arms, and each time he clasped
only the unsubstantial water. Maddened by these
repeated defeats, he spoke reproachfully to the
water-nymph, and asked her why she thus tormented
him; but though the lovely mouth so near his own
seemed to move as if framing words, no answer
came to his appeal.</p>

<p>Each day Narcissus sought the forest pool, and
each day he found the nymph ready to return his
smiles and fond looks, but always escaping from his
touch. By and by he spent all his time beside her,
and cared for nothing else than to gaze beseechingly
into the lovely eyes that looked into his own with
the same fever of longing. Absorbed in the adoration
of this strange being who seemed so responsive
to his passion and yet so unwilling to allow him
near, he forgot to eat or sleep, and became only a
wan shadow of his former self. The nymph, too,
was pining away with hopeless love, for her face
grew pale and thin, and the deep-shadowed eyes
were full of sadness. Sometimes Narcissus slept
from sheer exhaustion; but when the moonlight fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
on the calm water, he would wake with a start and
look anxiously to see whether the nymph was sharing
his weary vigil. And always he found her waiting
there in the cool depths of the pool. Finally
he grew so sick with longing that he died of his
hopeless love without ever knowing that it was no
water-nymph whom he adored, but only his own
reflection. The gods, believing that such devotion
should not go unrecognized, changed him into a
white flower which bears his name; and this is usually
found blooming beside some clear lake or tiny
crystal pool.</p>

<h3 id="pyramus">II. Pyramus and Thisbe</h3>

<p>In far-off Babylon there dwelt a youth and
maiden whose families lived in adjoining houses
with a party-wall between the two estates. As the
heads of these households were sworn enemies, in
spite of their proximity, the wall was made so high
that no one could climb over it, much less see
what was on the other side. The maiden Thisbe,
as she walked in her garden, often wondered who it
was whose feet she could hear pacing up and down
along the wall; and one day she was delighted to
find a small crack in the masonry which enabled
her to peep into the adjoining garden. About this
time young Pyramus was planning some way to
scale the wall, when he, too, discovered the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
chink; and when he peered cautiously through it,
he found to his great joy that there was a sweet-faced
maiden standing near, who hastened to assure
him that she did not share in the family feud.
This acquaintance soon ripened into friendship, and
Pyramus and Thisbe spent many hours standing
patiently by the chink in the wall, which was the
only way in which they could exchange confidences.
Soon they grew dissatisfied with this meager allowance
of space in which to see each other, for by this
time they had become so much in love that the
tender whispers breathed through the broken wall
only made them long to be together without this
cruel barrier between them.</p>

<p>So they planned to steal away from their watchful
parents on a certain night, and meet just outside
the city walls at Ninus's tomb, where a great white
mulberry tree would hide them in its protecting
shadow. Accordingly, at the appointed hour, the
trembling Thisbe wrapped herself closely in her
veil and crept out of the house. Finding that she
had come first to the trysting-place, she waited
under the mulberry tree, and idly watched the
moonlight shining on a broad pool that lay close to
Ninus's tomb. Suddenly a lioness stole out of the
bushes, her mouth bloody with the recent gorging
of oxen, and slunk down to the pool to drink.
Thisbe, terrified at the sight of the creature's dripping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
jaws, fled into a near-by cave for refuge; but
in her fright she let fall her silken veil, and it
dropped on the ground near the tree.</p>

<p>The lioness having drunk her fill walked over
to the tree and sniffed curiously at the bit of silk,
then worried at it with her bloody teeth, as a dog
plays with a rag. Just as the lioness departed,
Pyramus came hurrying to the trysting-place, and
seeing Thisbe's torn and blood-stained veil and the
print of the lioness's feet on the ground, he was
beside himself with remorse and horror. Being
certain that his beloved had been torn to pieces
by some wild beast, he cursed his own carelessness
in letting her come first to a spot so full of dangers.
Then he drew his sword, exclaiming that he no
longer wished to live now that Thisbe was dead.
He called upon the mulberry tree to bear witness
to his oath of undying devotion, and then fell
heroically upon his sword, uttering the name of
Thisbe with his last breath. As his blood gushed
out upon the ground at the foot of the tree, the
earth absorbed it so quickly that the white fruit
of the tree turned a deep purple, and its juice became
like drops of crimson blood.</p>

<p>All this time Thisbe was hiding safely in the
cave, and when she at length ventured out, she
gazed fearfully around to be sure that no lioness
was lying in wait to devour her. When she reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
the spot where she hoped to meet her lover, what
was her terror and dismay to find him stretched
dead upon the ground with her veil held close to
his parted lips. Realizing what had happened, and
that it was too late now to convince him of his terrible
mistake, Thisbe knelt down beside him and
vainly strove to bring him back to life. Finding
this useless, she seized Pyramus's sword and plunged
it into her heart determined to die with him. As
she sank forward on her lover's lifeless body, she
prayed the gods to have pity on her great love and
to allow her to be buried in the same tomb with her
beloved Pyramus. The gods heard her dying prayer
and answered it by making the hard hearts of the
parents relent so far that they consented to bury
the lovers together. A costly tomb was erected
over them as a fitting monument to these two unfortunates
whom life so cruelly <span class="locked">divided.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span></p>

<h3 id="hero">III. Hero and Leander</h3>

<p>In the town of Sestus on the Hellespont lived
a beautiful maiden named Hero, who was a priestess
in the temple of Venus. Most of her time
was spent in the service of the goddess; but when
these hours of attendance were over, and she
was free to leave the temple, Hero was glad to
seek her own dwelling-place, which was a lonely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
tower on the cliffs overlooking the sea. Here the
maiden loved to sit, watching the white-winged gulls
as they skimmed over the waves, or listening to the
breakers as they dashed angrily against the rocks at
the foot of her tower. The beauty of Hero was
famed throughout the country-side; and many a
youth sought the temple of Venus at festival time
under the pretext of honoring the goddess, but really
to gaze upon the lovely young priestess. Among
those most eager to see the maiden was Leander,
a youth who lived in a town just across the Hellespont
and within sight of Hero's tower. When he
joined the solemn procession that came to do homage
to Venus, he saw the beautiful priestess and determined
to win her in spite of the many restrictions
that forbade even an acquaintance with one dedicated
to the temple. Ignoring the thought of the
inevitable punishment that would be meted out to
him if his rash presumption were known, Leander
managed to find an opportunity to speak with
Hero and to tell her of his love.</p>

<p>At first she would not listen to his pleading; but
at last she was won by the sincerity of his words,
and consented to disregard her sacred vows by
receiving him in her tower. Leander did not dare
to visit her until nightfall; and as he would have to
swim across the Hellespont in the darkness, Hero
promised to put a light in her tower so that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
might have some beacon to guide him as he
breasted the uncertain sea. When night came and
Leander stood impatiently on the shore, waiting for
the promised signal, suddenly a torch blazed in the
distance, and he knew that Hero was awaiting him
in her lonely tower. He plunged fearlessly into
the waves; and though the current was swift, he
struck out boldly and was carried out of its dangerous
grip. Now and then he looked up to where
the light was still burning, and his heart beat fast
with hope when he saw it grow larger and brighter
as he neared the land. At last he reached the rocks
at the foot of the tower and was soon standing beside
the trembling Hero, who had feared each
moment to see him sink beneath the waves.</p>

<p>The lovers were so happy in being together that
each night Leander swam across the treacherous sea,
and Hero placed her torch in the tower to light
him on his perilous journey. All summer they
lived in this idyllic happiness, but when winter
came with its storms and its icy hand, Hero feared
for her lover's safety and begged him not to venture
into the sea. Leander laughed however at her fears
and continued to brave the narrow stretch of water
that lay between his home and Hero's tower. The
wind often beat him out of his path, and the icy
water numbed his limbs; but he kept bravely on,
with his eyes fixed on the welcoming light. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
morning a fierce storm broke over the sea, and increased
in fury through the day, so that by night
the waves were lashing themselves madly against
the rocks, and the wind beat the sea-gulls back to
land. Hero dreaded the approach of that hour
when Leander would start on his nightly journey,
for she knew that he would not hesitate to risk his
life in the maddened sea for the sake of being beside
her.</p>

<p>When the time came for her to light the torch,
she did so reluctantly, hoping that Leander would
not come. On the opposite shore stood the impatient
lover, waiting for the accustomed signal, and
when it blazed out into the night, he plunged
boldly into the waves. But now the sea was too
strong even for his experienced arms, and the huge
waves tossed him about as though he were so much
foam. The wind and rain beat upon his defenseless
body, and the cold sea gripped him in its deadly
embrace. He struggled bravely to make some
headway, and called upon the gods for help; but
his cries were drowned in the howling of the storm.
His strength began to fail as he fought desperately
with the current,&mdash;grown terrible in its swiftness,&mdash;but
now and then he lifted his head weakly above
the waves to see whether Hero's torch was still
burning. Just as he was making a last heroic effort
to reach the land, a sudden gust of wind blew out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
the light; and seeing this, Leander with a despairing
cry, gave up his unequal battle and sank down into
the sea. The next morning when Hero, anxious
and fearful, stood on the rocks at the foot of the
tower, she saw Leander's body, which had been
tossed there in wanton cruelty by the waves. Unable
to endure this sight, and not wishing to live
any longer now that her lover had perished, Hero
threw herself into the sea; and when the tardy
fishermen came to launch their boats on the furious
waves, they found the white-robed body of the
young priestess lying dead beside her faithful
<span class="locked">Leander.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></span></p>

<h3 id="pygmalion">IV. Pygmalion and Galatea</h3>

<p>Pygmalion, king of Cyprus, was a sworn bachelor,
and had shunned the society of women for many
years. He was also a famous sculptor, and spent all
his leisure hours carving wonderful things out of
marble and ivory. Though he would not deign to
admire any living woman, he had lofty ideals of
feminine beauty, and loved to carve statues whose
perfection of form and exquisite grace surpassed any
charms that could be claimed for a flesh-and-blood
maiden. Once Pygmalion made a beautiful ivory
statue that was such a marvel of loveliness that even
the sculptor himself became enamored of it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
lavished upon it a devotion that was hardly consistent
with his supposed indifference to love. This
perfect creation he called Galatea, and he treated
her with all the extravagant fondness that a lover
bestows upon his mistress. He brought her presents
of quaint seashells and delicately perfumed flowers,
beads, pearls, and the rarest of jewels, and even
gayly colored birds. Sometimes he hung a string of
precious stones about her neck, and draped her
white body in softest silks, treating her in every way
as a maiden reluctant to be wooed.</p>

<p>When the festival of Venus was being celebrated,
Pygmalion joined in the procession and placed a
rich offering on the goddess's shrine. As he did so
he looked up toward high Olympus and prayed
Venus to grant him a wife like his peerless Galatea.
The goddess heard his prayer, and as the patroness
of all true lovers, she inclined with favor to his wish;
so when Pygmalion returned to his home and
hastened into the presence of his adored statue, he
was bewildered at the change that seemed to be
coming over it. A beam of sunset light that was
streaming in through the open window had touched
the ivory coldness of the statue and warmed it with
a rosy glow that made it look wonderfully soft and
yielding. But this was not all, for as the astonished
sculptor stood wondering at this unexpected answer
to his prayer, the beautiful face of Galatea turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
toward him, and the perfect lips parted as if to speak.
Breathlessly Pygmalion watched the statue gradually
warming into life, and when he was at last assured
that it was no longer a piece of unresponsive ivory,
but a breathing, blushing maiden, he knelt adoringly
at her feet and besought her to be his <span class="locked">queen.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span></p>

<span class="subhead">The Story of Orpheus and Eurydice</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> deeds of the immortal gods were told and
sung at every fireside in Greece; and among
these hero-tales there was none more popular
than the story of how Apollo built for Neptune the
famous wall of Troy. Many musicians would have
been glad to perform a similar service for the mere
fame that it would bring them, but they feared that
the attempt to imitate Apollo would only result in
failure and ridicule. So no mortal ever presumed
to say that he could make rocks and stones obedient
to the spell of his music. There was, however, one
musician, Amphion, king of Thebes, who was
anxious to prove that his playing was equal to
Apollo's, but knowing how unwise it was to vie with
an immortal, he determined not to test his skill
publicly, but to carry out his cherished plan at
night, when men were dreaming in their beds. He
was eager to build a high wall around Thebes, and
to build it as Apollo did the wall of Troy; so when
the sun set, and darkness crept over the earth,
Amphion stood just outside the city gates and began
to play on his lyre. Immediately the stones rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
from the ground and moved rhythmically into their
places in the wall, which soon rose strong and high&mdash;a
firmer defense than any that could be built by
men's <span class="locked">hands.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span></p>

<p>Another famous musician was Arion, who won not
only praise for his great skill in playing, but also
much wealth. Whenever a contest was held in
which a prize of money was given, Arion was usually
a competitor; and, as his music was really finer than
that of most players, he easily won the reward.
Once he was returning from a festival in Sicily
whither many musicians had gone on account of the
rich prize; and as he had come off victor, he was
leaving the foreign shores well-laden with gold.
Unfortunately he happened to embark on a ship
owned by pirates who had heard of his great wealth,
and were plotting to seize whatever part of it he had
on board. As the easiest way to do this was to kill
him, the pirates began to bind him with ropes that
he might not be able to struggle when thrown over-board.
Arion calmly accepted his fate, but begged
the brutal crew to allow him to play once upon
his lyre before going to his death. To this the
pirates consented, and when the wonderful music
filled the air, a school of dolphins swam toward the
ship and kept close beside it, charmed by Arion's
playing. Feeling sure that there was some magic in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
the music, the pirates hastened to throw the player
and his lyre into the sea without waiting to bind
him; but Arion did not drown as they had expected,
for a friendly dolphin caught him on its back and
swam with him to the shore, where he landed in
safety. When in the course of time Arion died,
the gods placed him, together with his lyre and the
kindly dolphin, in the sky as constellations.</p>

<p>The most famous of all musicians, except the one
who played in the shining halls of Olympus, was
Orpheus, son of Apollo and of the muse <span class="locked">Calliope.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span>
When he was a mere child, his father gave him a
lyre and taught him to play upon it; but Orpheus
needed very little instruction, for as soon as he laid
his hand upon the strings the wild beasts crept out
of their lairs to crouch beside him; the trees on the
mountain-side moved nearer so that they might
listen; and the flowers sprang up in clusters all
around him, unwilling to remain any longer asleep
in the earth.</p>

<p>When Orpheus sought in marriage the golden-haired
Eurydice, there were other suitors for her
hand, but though they brought rich gifts, gathered
out of many lands, they could not win the maiden's
love, and she turned from them to bestow her hand
upon Orpheus who had no way to woo her but with
his music. On the wedding day there was the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
mirth and feasting, but one event occurred that cast
a gloom over the happiness of the newly-married
pair. When Hymen, god of marriage, came with
his torch to bless the nuptial feast, the light that
should have burned clear and pure began to smoke
ominously, as if predicting future disaster.</p>

<p>This evil omen was fulfilled all too soon, for one
day when Eurydice was walking in the meadow, she
met the youth Aristæus, who was so charmed with
her beauty that he insisted upon staying beside her
to pour his ardent speeches into her unwilling ears.
To escape from these troublesome attentions,
Eurydice started to run away, and as she ran she
stepped on a poisonous snake, which quickly turned
and bit her. She had barely time to reach her home
before the poison had done its work, and Orpheus
heard the sad story from her dying lips. As soon
as Mercury had led away the soul of Eurydice, the
bereaved husband hastened to the shining halls of
Olympus, and throwing himself down before Jupiter's
golden throne, he implored that great ruler of
gods and men to give him back his wife. There
was always pity in the hearts of the gods for those
who die in flowering time, so Jupiter gave permission
to Orpheus to go down into Hades, and beg of
Pluto the boon he craved.</p>

<p>It was a steep and perilous journey to the kingdom
of the dead, and the road was one that no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
mortal foot had ever trod; but through his love for
Eurydice Orpheus forgot the dangers of the way,
and when he spoke her name, the terrors of the
darkness vanished. In his hand he held his lyre,
and when he arrived at the gate of Hades, where the
fierce three-headed dog Cerberus refused to let him
pass, Orpheus stood still in the uncertain darkness
and began to play. And as he played the snarling
of the dog ceased and the noise of its harsh breathing
grew faint. Then Orpheus went on his way undisturbed,
but still he played softly on his lyre, and the
sounds floated far into the dismal interior of Hades,
where the souls of the condemned labor forever at
their tasks. Tantalus heard the music, and ceased
to strive for a drop of the forbidden water; Ixion
rested a moment beside his ever-revolving wheel;
and Sisyphus stood listening, while the rock which
he must roll through all eternity fell from his
wearied arms. The daughters of Danaüs laid down
their urns beside the sieve into which they were forever
pouring water, and as the mournful wailing of
Orpheus's lyre told the story of his lost love, they
wept then for a sorrow not their own. So plaintive,
indeed, was the music, that all the shadowy forms
that flitted endlessly by shed tears of sympathy for
the player's grief, and even the cheeks of the Furies
were wet.</p>

<p>When Orpheus came before the throne of Pluto,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
that relentless monarch repulsed him angrily as
he attempted to plead his cause, and commanded
him to depart. Then the son of Apollo began to
play upon his lyre, and through his music he told
the story of his loss, and besought the ruler of these
myriad souls to give him the single one he craved.
So wonderfully did Orpheus play that the hard
heart of Pluto was touched with pity, and he consented
to restore Eurydice to her husband on condition
that as they went out together from the loathed
country of the dead he should not once turn his
head to look upon her. To this strange decree
Orpheus gladly promised obedience; so Eurydice
was summoned from among the million shadow-shapes
that throng the silent halls of death. Pluto
told her the condition on which her freedom was to
be won, and then bade her follow her husband.</p>

<div id="ip_112" class="figcenter" style="width: 321px;"><img src="images/i112.jpg" width="321" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">Orpheus and Eurydice</div></div>

<p>During all the wearisome journey back to earth,
Orpheus never forgot the promise he had made,
though he often longed to give just a hurried glance
at the face of Eurydice to see whether it had lost
its sadness. As they neared the spot where the
first faint glimmerings of light filtered down into the
impenetrable darkness, Orpheus thought he heard
his wife calling, and he looked quickly around to
find whether she was still following him. At that
moment the slight form close behind him began to
fade away, and a mournful voice&mdash;seemingly far in
the distance&mdash;called to him a sad farewell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
He knew that no second chance would be given
him to win his wife from Pluto's hold, even if he
could again charm the three-headed Cerberus or
persuade Charon, the grim ferryman, to take him
across the river. So he went forlornly back to
earth and lived in a forest cave far from the companionship
of men. At first there was only his lyre
to share his solitude, but soon the forest creatures
came to live beside him, and often sat listening to
his music, looking exceedingly wise and sorrowful.
Even in his sleepless hours, when he fancied he
heard Eurydice calling, he was never quite alone,
for the bat and owl and the things that love the
darkness flitted about him, and he saw the glow-worms
creep toward him out of the night-cold grass.</p>

<p>One day a party of Bacchantes found him seated
outside the cave, playing the mournful music that
told of his lost love, and they bade him change the
sad notes to something gay so that they might
dance. But Orpheus was too wrapped up in his
sorrow to play any strain of cheerful music, and he
refused to do as they asked. The Bacchantes were
half maddened by their festival days of drinking,
and this refusal so enraged them that they fell upon
the luckless musician and tore him to pieces. Then
they threw his mangled body into the river, and as

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> three children of Jupiter and Juno were
Hebe, Mars, and Vulcan. Hebe, goddess
of youth, was cupbearer at the feasts of
Olympus and poured from golden flagons the sparkling,
ruby-tinted nectar. Many times were the
brimming cups emptied and filled again, for the
gods loved long draughts of the life-giving nectar
that kept off all sickness and decay. No wine of
earth's yielding ever appeared at these royal banquets,
nor were there seen here the heaped-up
platters of food such as mortals crave; for the gods
ate only of the divine ambrosia which insured to
them eternal youth and beauty.</p>

<p>For so long a time had fair-haired Hebe served at
the feasts of Olympus that the gods never thought
that she could be deprived of her office; but once,
as she was handing Jupiter a well-filled cup, she
stumbled and fell, and the ruler of gods and men
was so angry that he vowed that she should never
again be cupbearer. Since no one among the gods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
was willing to fill this humble position, Jupiter was
obliged to seek over the earth for some mortal to
take the place of poor disgraced Hebe. To make
the journey as speedily as possible he assumed the
form of an eagle, and spent many days soaring over
the land before he found the youth whose slender
grace made him feel assured that its possessor would
be able to serve the gods less awkwardly than Hebe.
On the sunny slopes of Mount Ida he saw a group
of youths playing games, and among them was one
whom Jupiter determined to bear away at once to
Olympus. This was Ganymede, a prince of Troy;
and the fact that he was no common mortal, but a
king's son, did not deter Jupiter from swooping
down upon the astonished youth, and carrying him
aloft on his wings. Whether Ganymede was happy
in Olympus we do not know; but the story goes
that he remained forever at Jupiter's side, and the
city of Troy never saw him again, nor did the king
his father ever know the reason for his strange
disappearance.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Mars<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> was the god of war; and though he was
the least loved of all the deities in Olympus, he
was the one most feared by the people of every
land. As he was always a hater of peace, and would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
stir up strife among men for the mere delight of
fighting and bloodshed, the poet Homer calls him
"the slayer of men, one steeped in blood, the
destroyer of walled towns." His shrines were
never wreathed with flowers, nor were children often
found among the people grouped about his altars.
Instead of the yearling ox with gilded horns, men
sacrificed a savage bull to the god who took no
pleasure in the tame shedding of blood. Sometimes
Bellona, goddess of war, accompanied Mars in his
chariot to watch over his safety; and since she was
equally eager to urge men on to bloody fighting,
their appearance together on the battle-field brought
terror to the bravest heart. Seldom were prayers
addressed to these two deities, except those of vengeance
upon enemies; and there was little hope of
peace for the nation when men thronged the temples
where Mars and Bellona were jointly worshiped.
The fiercest passions were kindled at their shrines,
and their altars were the only ones that were ever
defiled by human sacrifices.</p>

<p>Though so fierce in warfare, Mars was as susceptible
to love as were all the immortals; for he was
not only the chosen one of golden-haired Venus,
but was also the devoted lover of the vestal Rhea
<span class="locked">Silvia.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span> This maiden, being dedicated to the goddess
Vesta, did not dare to listen to any words of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
love until her time of service in the temple was over;
for the penalty of breaking her solemn vows would
be the terrible one of being buried alive. But Mars
was not to be denied; so at last the vestal yielded,
but kept her marriage secret and continued to live in
the temple until the birth of her twin sons Romulus
and Remus. When her parents learned that she had
failed to keep the sacred promise made at the altar
fire of Vesta, they demanded that she should suffer
the prescribed punishment. She was therefore taken
at night into an underground room of the temple
and inclosed in the wall which had been built to
allow for just such a tragic event. As her children
were declared outcasts, they were taken into the
forest and left to perish by the teeth of wild beasts.
Romulus and Remus did not die, however; for a
she-wolf carried them to her lair and reared them
with her own cubs. Later on they were found by a
kindly shepherd who took care of them until they
grew to manhood. Then they left him, and went
out into the world to seek adventures, which soon
ended in Romulus killing his brother Remus and
himself becoming the founder of Rome.</p>

<p>When this new city was well established, Mars
was made its patron deity and protector; and before
an army set out on any military campaign the leader
would first go into the temple where the sacred
shield&mdash;the Ancile&mdash;hung; and touching it fearfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
would pray, "Oh, Mars, watch over us."
This shield was carefully guarded in Rome, for upon
it depended the safety of the city. It was a special
token sent by the god of war to show that the people
of Rome were under his protection; for once when
a plague was raging among them and the dead were
numbered by thousands, the Romans fled to the temple
of Mars and begged him to help them. As they
were praying, a shield fell from the skies into their
midst, and a voice told them that as long as this&mdash;the
sacred Ancile&mdash;was with them, no harm could
come to Rome. That day the plague ceased, and
ever afterward the shield was jealously guarded. To
insure its safety, eleven other shields were made so
like the Ancile that no one but the Salii, the priests
of the temple, knew which it was. These were carried
in the streets during the festivals in honor of
Mars which were held in March&mdash;the month that
bears his name; and as the priests bore aloft the
shields they sang war-songs and performed rude war
dances. Sometimes the shields were displayed on
the broad grounds where the soldiers and youths of
the city held their exercises. This place was dedicated
to the god of war, and was called the Campus
Martius, or Field of Mars.</p>

<p>During the war between the gods and giants, Mars
was so eager to prove his skill in warfare that he
engaged in a fierce battle with Otus and Ephialtes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
These two giants were only nine years old; but they
were already of immense size, as they increased in
height at the rate of nine inches every month. The
young giants were very proud of having conquered
the god of war, and carried him off the battle-field
in triumph. They bound Mars with iron chains,
and kept a careful guard over him so that none of
the gods could set him free. Whenever Mars
attempted to escape at night, believing that the
giants were asleep, the rattle of the chains woke
his guardians, and all hope of rescuing him was
over. In this disgraceful bondage the unhappy
Mars lingered for fifteen months until Mercury,
the prince of thieves, unfastened the chains and
restored the god to freedom.</p>

<p>When Cadmus went on his search for his sister
Europa, whom Jupiter, in the form of a white bull,
had carried off to a distant <span class="locked">land,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span> the devoted
brother was at last bidden to give up his hopeless
quest, to settle in the country, later called Bœotia,
and to found a city there. Cadmus was glad to
rest after his long march, and he sent some of
his men in search of a spring. When they did not
come back, he sent others to look for them, and
when these did not return, he went himself to see
what had caused all this delay. He carried his sword
in his hand, and also a long spear, for he guessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
that some disaster had overtaken his men. He wandered
some time before he discovered any trace
of them, and then at the edge of a forest he
came upon the lifeless body of one of those who
had first set out to find the spring. As he went
farther into the forest he found others of his men,
all of them lifeless, and soon he came to a large
cave, at the entrance of which bubbled a fountain
of purest water.</p>

<p>Not knowing that this was a grove sacred to
Mars, and a fountain that had never been polluted
by mortal touch, Cadmus stooped to drink, when
suddenly, out of the deep shadows of the cave,
rushed a huge dragon with crested head and glittering
scales and a triple tongue vibrating between
triple rows of teeth. This monster, twisting his
body into a huge coil, darted toward Cadmus with
gleaming fangs; but the young prince dealt his
assailant a terrific blow that pierced the dragon in
a vital spot, and it rolled over dead upon the
floor of the cave. Then Cadmus heard a voice
telling him to take out the dragon's teeth and to
sow them in the ground where he wished to build
his future city of Thebes. As soon as the teeth
were sown, a crop of giants in glittering armor
sprang up out of the ground, and when they were
about to turn their spears upon Cadmus, he again
heard the voice&mdash;this time bidding him throw a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
stone into the midst of the armed men. This
caused a terrific battle to begin among the giants
themselves, and soon they were all killed except five
who laid down their weapons and offered their
services to Cadmus.</p>

<p>As a punishment for the desecration of his grove
and the slaying of its sacred guardian, Mars compelled
Cadmus to serve him for eight years. At
the end of this time the prince was made ruler
of the new city of Thebes, and Mars so far forgave
the sacrilege of his grove as to give Cadmus
his daughter Harmonia in marriage. The career
of the new king was very prosperous at first, and
Cadmus was supposed to have contributed a great
boon to his people by the invention of the alphabet.
Later on he incurred the wrath of the gods by
forgetting to offer them suitable sacrifices, and
both he and his wife Harmonia were changed into
serpents.</p>

<p>Just above the city of Athens was a hill called
the Areopagus (from the Greek word meaning
Mars Hill), which received its name from a famous
trial that took place there. Neptune's son had
carried off the daughter of Mars; and when the
god of war learned of the abduction, he hurried
after the daring youth and killed him. Then Neptune
demanded that Mars should be punished for
his deed of blood; and to decide the matter, both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
were summoned to appear before a court of justice,
which was held on the hill above Athens. As it
was the custom for all important cases to be tried
at night, so that the judges might not be prejudiced
by the favorable appearance of either party, the
court assembled in the darkness, and Mars told
the story of his daughter's capture and his own
subsequent revenge. In spite of Neptune's objections
to what he considered an unfair verdict, the
judges decided in favor of Mars, and he was therefore
acquitted. The hill was afterwards called by
his name, and the judges of the principal court of
justice were always termed <i xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">areopagitæ</i>.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Vulcan,<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> god of fire and the forge, was not often
seen in the halls of Olympus, for he knew that the
gods despised him for his ungainly appearance, and
he preferred to stay in his own sooty workshop.
He had also no desire for the society of his divine
parents, since his mother had never shown anything
but indifference toward him, and his father had been
the cause of his deformity. Jupiter was once so
angry with Juno for interfering in his love affairs
that he fastened her to the end of a strong chain,
and hung her out of heaven. Vulcan, seeing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
mother in this sad plight, dragged at the chain and
finally succeeded in drawing Juno into safety. Full
of wrath at this defiance of his wishes, Jupiter
kicked his son out of heaven; and as the distance
of the fall was so great, it was a whole day and night
before Vulcan reached the earth. Had he been a
mortal, there would have been nothing left to tell
the story of his meteorlike descent; but being a
god, he still lived and had only a slight deformity
and lameness as the result of his fall. When he
learned that Juno was so unconcerned over his fate
that she had never even inquired whether he was
badly hurt, he would not go back to Olympus, but
shut himself up in the heart of Mount Etna, where
he established a mighty forge that poured out fire
and smoke for many years after.</p>

<p>Vulcan did not forget about his mother's heartless
indifference; but none of the gods suspected
him of harboring any revenge, until one day a beautiful
golden throne arrived in Olympus as a present
to Juno from her son. The goddess admired the
exquisite designs carved on its polished surface, and
seated herself in it proudly. Now Vulcan had contrived
to hide some springs in the interior of the
throne, and these were so skillfully arranged that the
moment a person was seated, the entire structure
quickly contracted and held the occupant prisoner.
So in a moment proud Juno found herself securely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
caught, and no assistance that the gods could render
her was of the least avail. Then Jupiter sent Mercury
to the grimy abode of Vulcan to beg politely
that the god of fire would honor, with his presence,
the feast that was that day to be held in Olympus;
but Vulcan was not to be moved by any flattery, for
he well knew why he was so much desired at this
particular time. So Mercury returned alone to
Olympus, and Jupiter was obliged to think of some
other device for luring Vulcan from his forge. This
time he sent Bacchus, god of wine; and when the
scowling deity of Etna saw Bacchus's jolly red face
and heard his hearty laugh, he welcomed the jovial
visitor and drank freely of the wine that Bacchus
poured. The roisterous god of revels, who dearly
loved to see good wine flowing, beguiled Vulcan
into taking draught after draught of the choice
vintage that he had purposely brought, until the
sullen master of the forge was unable to tell what
was happening, and allowed himself to be led unresistingly
to Olympus. Once there the gods persuaded
him to release the repentant Juno, and to
allow himself to be reinstated in Jupiter's favor.</p>

<p>Though Vulcan grudgingly complied with these
requests, he would not consent to live in Olympus,
but returned to his workshop in Mount Etna. There
he made many things out of gold and precious
stones and gave them to the gods as an evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
that he no longer bore them any ill will. Their
golden thrones were made by Vulcan's crafty hands,
and the wonderful palaces, with all their costly furnishings,
were the best result of his skill. He also
forged Jupiter's thunderbolts and fashioned the
weapons that the gods used in battle. He made
Apollo's marvelous sun-chariot, and even deigned to
use his skill in shaping the arrows that Cupid used
in his golden bow.</p>

<p>When Jupiter <span class="locked">decreed<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span> that laughter-loving Venus
should wed his misshapen son, Vulcan took his reluctant
wife to the smoky workshop in Mount Etna,
and for a while Venus was amused at the unusual
sights and sounds that greeted her in her new home;
but she soon wearied of the dirt and darkness, and
left the society of her surly husband to return to
Olympus, where there was plenty to delight her
pleasure-loving soul.</p>

<span class="subhead">The Story of Proserpina</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">When</span> Jupiter made himself ruler of the
world, he imprisoned some of the warring
giants under Mount Etna in Sicily, much
to the disgust of Pluto, who was always fearing that
when the giants got restless and turned over and
over underground (thus causing earthquakes), they
would some day make such a large crack in the
earth that daylight would be let into Hades. So
Pluto often went up out of his sunless land to look
carefully over the island, and to be sure that no
new fissure was being made in the earth's surface.
One day, as he was driving his four coal-black
horses through the vale of Enna, he saw a group
of maidens gathering violets on the hillside; and
among them was one so exquisitely fair that Pluto
determined to take her for his wife. This was
<span class="locked">Proserpina,<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span> daughter of Ceres, the goddess of
agriculture, a maiden who had ever shunned the
thought of marriage and preferred to spend her life
playing games, and dancing in the beautiful plain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
Enna, where there is never any frost or snow, but
springtime lasts through all the year.</p>

<p>Pluto had often tried to gain a wife by gentle
means, but no one would consent to share his grewsome
home; so, knowing that this maiden he desired
would never listen to soft words of love, he
determined to take her by force. Driving his fiery
horses at full speed, he rushed toward the group of
laughing girls, who scattered and fled at his approach.
Proserpina alone stood still, and stared, frightened
and wondering, at the grim figure confronting her,
while the flowers she had gathered dropped from
her trembling hands. In a moment Pluto had
seized her in his strong arms; and, trampling all
her violets under his ruthless feet, he sprang into
the chariot and urged his horses to their full speed,
hoping to reach Hades before the maiden's cries
brought Ceres to the rescue.</p>

<p>As he neared the Cyane River the waters, wishing
to befriend Proserpina, began to rise higher and
higher, and with tossing waves opposed the madly-rushing
steeds. Fearing to risk the chariot in the
angry waters, Pluto struck the ground with his terrible
two-pronged fork, and a great chasm opened
before him, into which the ruler of Hades hurriedly
plunged. Then the earth closed again over him
and the captured maiden. During the dreadful moments
when Proserpina felt herself held a prisoner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
in the arms of this bold wooer, she called wildly to
her mother for help; but soon she realized that her
cries would never reach Ceres's ears, and that she
must find some other way to let the goddess know
of her unhappy fate. So she summoned enough
strength to struggle in her captor's embrace until she
freed one arm from his hold, and with it loosened
her girdle, which she flung into the Cyane River just
before the yawning earth hid her so completely that
no traces were left to tell where she had gone.</p>

<p>When <span class="locked">Ceres<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span> came that evening into the vale of
Enna and found that her daughter was not playing
as usual with the other maidens, she questioned
them, and learned their tearful story of the chariot
with its four black horses and terrible driver. Just
what had become of Proserpina no one could tell
her; so the distracted mother began her search, not
knowing whether she might at any moment come
upon her daughter's body mangled by the chariot
wheels. For days and days she wandered, never
stopping to rest except for a few hours at night
when it was too dark for her to see her way. Rosy-fingered
Aurora, when she left her soft couch to
open the gates of the morning, and Hesperus, when
he led out the stars at evening, saw her still searching
for the lost Proserpina. Sometimes she was so
weary that she sank down by the roadside and let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
the night-dew drench her aching limbs. Sometimes
she rested under the trees when a storm broke over
her head; but even here the rain beat down upon
her, and the wind blew its cold breath in her face.
Kindly people gave her food whenever she stopped
to ask for it, and though none knew that she was a
goddess, they sympathized with her grief when she
told them that she was seeking her lost child. Only
once did she meet with unkindness. She was sitting
at a cottage door eating gruel from a bowl, and a
lad&mdash;Stellio by name&mdash;laughed insolently at her
enjoyment of the meal. To punish him for his
rudeness the goddess threw some of the gruel in his
face, and immediately he was changed into a lizard.</p>

<p>One day Ceres found herself near the city of
Eleusis, and to avoid being recognized as a goddess,
she disguised herself as an old beggar woman. She
sat for a long time on a stone by the roadside,
mourning her lost Proserpina, until a little girl
came by, driving some goats. Seeing the old
woman's tearful face, the child stopped to ask her
her trouble, but before Ceres could answer, the
girl's father joined her and together they begged
the stranger to come to their cottage and rest. The
goddess yielded at last to their kindly insistence,
and as she walked beside the old man, whose name
was Celeus, he told her that at home he had a sick
boy who had lately grown so ill that to-day they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
believed he would surely die. Ceres listened to his
pathetic story, and for a moment forgot her own
grief. Seeing a chance to return the old man's
kindness, she followed him into the cottage; but
first stopped by the meadow to gather a handful of
poppies. When the parents led her to the sick
child's bedside, she stooped and kissed the pale
little face and immediately it became rosy with
health. The boy sprang up well and strong again,
to the great astonishment of his delighted family.</p>

<p>As they sat at the simple evening meal, the goddess
put some poppy-juice in the glass of milk set
out for the boy; and that night, when he was in a
heavy sleep, she rubbed his body with oil, murmured
over him a solemn charm, and was about to lay him
on the red-hot ashes in the fire&mdash;that his mortal parts
might be consumed and he himself be made immortal&mdash;when
his mother chanced to enter the room, and
springing forward with a cry of horror, snatched the
boy from the fire. Before the excited mother could
vent her wrath on the old woman, Ceres assumed
her goddess form and quietly reproved the intruder;
for her interference had not averted a harm, but had
prevented a great gift from being conferred upon
the unconscious child.</p>

<p>When Ceres left the cottage of Celeus, she continued
her wanderings over the earth, and finally
returned, discouraged and heartbroken, to Sicily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
Chancing to be near the river Cyane, she went
down to the water's edge to drink, and happily discovered
the girdle that Proserpina had dropped
there in her flight. This made her hopeful of finding
further traces of her lost daughter, so she lingered
by the river bank, eagerly scanning the
overflowing stream. As she stood there holding
the recovered girdle in her hand, she heard a low
murmuring sound as if some one were speaking in
whispers. The goddess listened, wondering from
what place the voice came; and soon she found that
the soft tones proceeded from a fountain which was so
close to her that its lightly-tossed spray fell on her
hand. The murmur was often indistinct, but Ceres
understood enough to realize that the words were
addressed to her, and that the fountain was trying
to tell her how Pluto had come up from Hades
and carried off Proserpina to be his wife.</p>

<p>While the goddess was musing over this painful
revelation, the fountain went on to say that it had not
always been a stream in sunny Sicily, but was once a
maiden named <span class="locked">Arethusa<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span> and a native of the country
of Elis. As a follower of Diana she had roamed the
wooded hills; and one day, being wearied from the
chase, she sought refreshment in the forest stream.
The drooping willows hung protectingly over the
water, and here the nymph bathed fearlessly, believing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
herself alone. But Alpheus, the river-god,
heard the splashing of the water, and rose from his
grassy bed to see who was disturbing his noon-day
rest. At the sight of Arethusa he was so delighted
that he ventured to approach her; but she fled
terrified through the forest, calling on Diana for
help. The goddess, hearing her cries, changed her
into a fountain; and to further baffle the pursuing
Alpheus, she wrapped it in a thick mist. As the
river-god could no longer see the nymph, he was
about to give up the chase, when Zephyrus maliciously
blew away the cloud, and Alpheus saw
the bubbling fountain. Suspecting that this was
Arethusa, the god changed himself into a rushing
torrent, and was preparing to mingle his impetuous
waves with the waters of the fountain, when the
nymph again called on Diana to protect her. The
goddess came to her rescue by opening a crevice in
the earth, and here the shivering waters of the fountain
found a speedy refuge. To keep far out of
the reach of Alpheus it continued to flow underground
for many miles, and even crept beneath the
sea until it reached Sicily, where Diana again cleft
the earth and allowed the fountain to come up into
the sunlight. During her journey through the dark
underworld, Arethusa said that she had seen Proserpina
sitting, tearful and sad, on a throne beside the
grim ruler of the dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
When she heard this story, Ceres was no longer
in doubt where her lost daughter could be found;
but the knowledge gave her little comfort, for she
was aware how useless it would be to ask Pluto to
give up the wife he had so daringly won. Seeing
no hope of regaining her child, Ceres retired to a
cave in the hills, and paid no heed to the waiting
earth that had suffered so long from her neglect.
There was drought in the land, and the crops were
failing for want of water. The fruit trees were drying
up, and the flowers were withering on the parched
hillsides. Everything cried out for the protecting
care of Ceres; but the goddess stayed her hand, and
in the solitude of the cave mourned unceasingly for
Proserpina. Famine spread over the land, but the
people, in spite of their dire need of food, burned
sacrifices of sheep and oxen on the altars of Ceres,
while they importuned her with their prayers.
Jupiter heard their cries and besought the goddess
to take the earth again under her wise care; but
Ceres refused to listen, for she was indifferent now
to the welfare of men, and no longer delighted
in the ripening harvest.</p>

<p>When sickness and death followed hard upon
the famine, Jupiter saw that he must save the
sorely-stricken land, so he promised the goddess
that her daughter should be restored to her if
she had eaten nothing during all her sojourn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
in Pluto's realm. Mercury was sent to lead
Proserpina out of Hades; but when he reached
there, he found that Pluto had already given
his wife some pomegranate seeds, hoping that she
would thereby stay forever in his keeping. Dismayed
at this unexpected downfall of her hopes,
Ceres was about to shut herself up again in the cave,
when Jupiter, in behalf of the suffering earth, made
a compromise with Pluto whereby Proserpina was
to spend half her time with her mother in the land
of sunshine and flowers, and the rest with her husband
in cold and cheerless Hades. Each spring
Mercury was sent to lead Proserpina up from the
underworld lest her eyes, grown accustomed only to
shadows, should be dazzled by the blinding sunlight,
and she herself should lose the way. All things
awaited her coming; and as soon as her foot touched
the winter-saddened earth the flowers bloomed to
delight her eyes, the grass sprang up to carpet her
way with greenness, the birds sang to cheer her long-depressed
spirit, and above her the sun shone
brilliantly in the blue Sicilian sky.</p>

<p>Ceres no longer mourned, nor did she again suffer
a great famine to afflict the land. The patient old
earth smiled again on Proserpina's return, for then
her mother gave the blighted vegetation a redoubled
care. But her happiness did not make the goddess
forget the kindly old man who had given her food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
and shelter at Eleusis, for she returned there and
taught the boy Triptolemus all the secrets of agriculture.
She also gave him her chariot, and bade
him journey everywhere, teaching the people how to
plow and sow and reap, and care for their harvests.
Triptolemus carried out all her instructions; and as
he traveled over the country he was eagerly welcomed
alike by prince and peasant until he came to Scythia,
where the cruel King Lyncus would have killed him,
in a fit of jealous wrath, had not Ceres interfered
with timely aid and changed the treacherous monarch
into a lynx.</p>

<span class="subhead">Pluto and the Underworld</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">In</span> the beginning of the world, before the gods
came to dwell in Olympus, all the universe was
in the hands of the Titans; and among these
the greatest was Saturn,&mdash;or <span class="locked">Cronos,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span>&mdash;who wedded
his sister Rhea (also called Cybele) and became the
father of three sons and three daughters, Jupiter,
Pluto, Neptune, Ceres, Vesta, and Juno. For many
ages Saturn and Rhea, having subdued all the
opposing Titans, ruled over heaven and earth; but
when the cruelty of Saturn drove his children into
rebellion, there arose a mighty war in the universe,
in which the sons and daughters of Saturn leagued
against their father, who had called upon the other
Titans for aid. After years of combat the six brothers
and sisters, helped by the <span class="locked">Cyclops,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span> defeated the
allied Titans and imprisoned them in the black
abyss of Tartarus&mdash;all except a few who had not
joined in the war against the children of Saturn.
Among those who were wise enough to accept the
new sovereignty were Mnemosyne (Memory) and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Themis, goddess of justice. Those descendants of
the Titans who refused to acknowledge the supremacy
of Jupiter were consigned to the center of Mount
Etna, and were the giants who constantly turned
over and over, making Pluto fear for the safety
of his realm. A few of the giants were spared:
Atlas, whose punishment was to hold the heavens
on his shoulders, and Prometheus and Epimetheus
who had espoused the cause of Jupiter and so
escaped the fate of the conquered Titans. When
the children of Saturn found themselves masters of
the world, they agreed to accept Jupiter as their
ruler, on condition that the two other brothers be
given a share in the universe. So a division was
made whereby Pluto became king of the underworld&mdash;or
Hades; Neptune took the dominion of the
sea; and Jupiter, having married his sister, Juno,
established his dwelling in Olympus as lord of
heaven and earth.</p>

<p>The kingdom of <span class="locked">Pluto<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span> was dreaded by all
mortals, and its ruler inspired men with great fear.
Though Pluto was known to visit the earth from
time to time, no one wished to see his face, and each
man dreaded the moment when he should be obliged
to appear before the grim monarch of Hades, and
be assigned a place among the innumerable dead.
No temples were dedicated to Pluto, though altars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
were sometimes erected on which men burned sacrifices
to this inexorable god while petitioning him to
be merciful to the souls of the departed. The festivals
held in his honor were celebrated only once in
a hundred years, and on these occasions none but
black animals were killed for the sacrifice.</p>

<p>The underworld, over which Pluto reigned, was
deep in the heart of the earth; but there were
several entrances to it, one being near Lake Avernus,
where the mist rising from the waters was so foul
that no bird could fly over it. The lake itself was
in an extinct volcano near Vesuvius. It was very
deep, and was surrounded by high banks covered
with a thick forest. The first descent into Hades
could be easily accomplished (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">facilis descensus
Averno</i>, says the poet Virgil); but no mortal was
daring enough to venture far into the black depths,
lest he should never again see the light of day.</p>

<p>At the portals of Hades sits the fierce three-headed
dog Cerberus, who keeps all living things
from entering the gate, and allows no spirit that has
once been admitted to pass out again. From here
a long dark pathway leads deeper into Hades, and
is finally lost in the rivers that flow around Pluto's
throne. The waters of the river Cocytus are salt,
as they are made of the tears that stream forever
from the eyes of those unhappy souls who are condemned
to labor in Tartarus&mdash;that part of Hades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
that is the exclusive abode of the wicked. The
Phlegethon River, which is always on fire, separates
Tartarus from the rest of Hades, and wretched
indeed is the soul that is forced to cross its seething
waters. On the banks of the Acheron, a black and
turbid river, stand the souls who come fresh from
the sunlit earth; for all must pass this river and be
brought before the judgment-throne of Pluto.
There is no bridge over the murky stream, and the
current is so swift that the boldest swimmer would
not trust himself to its treacherous waters. The
only way to cross is by the leaky, worm-eaten boat
rowed by Charon, an aged ferryman who has plied
his oar ever since the day that the curse of death
first came upon the earth.</p>

<p>No spirit is allowed to enter the leaky craft until
he has first paid Charon the fee of a small coin called
the obolus. (During the funeral services, before the
body is committed for burial, this coin is laid on
the tongue of the dead, that the soul may have no
trouble in passing to the throne of Pluto.) If any
spirits cannot furnish the necessary money, they are
ruthlessly pushed aside by the mercenary boatman
and are required to wait a hundred years. At the
end of this time Charon grudgingly ferries them over
the river free of charge. As the unstable boat can
hold but few, there is always an eager group of
spirits on the further bank, clamoring to be taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
across the river; but Charon is never in a hurry,
and repulses, sometimes with his oar, the pitiful
crowd that waits his grim pleasure.</p>

<p>There is also in Hades the river Styx, by whose
sacred waters the gods swear the most terrible of all
oaths, and on the other side of Pluto's throne is the
softly flowing Lethe, of which only those souls can
drink who are to spend endless days of happiness in
the Elysian Fields. As soon as those blessed spirits
have tasted of the waters of Lethe, all regrets for
friends that mourn completely vanish, and the joy
and grief, and pleasure and pain of the soul's life on
earth are forgotten. In the Elysian Fields there is
no darkness such as fills the rest of Hades with its
thick gloom; but a soft light spreads over the
meadows where the spirits of the thrice-blessed
wander. There are willows here, and stately silver
poplars, and the "meads of Asphodel" breathe out
a faint perfume from their pale flowers.</p>

Beside Pluto's throne sit the three Fates (also

threads of life and death in their hands. Clotho,
the youngest, spins the thread; Lachesis, the second,
twines into it the joys and sorrows, hopes and fears

<p>Pluto and his queen Proserpina are seated side by
side on a sable throne, ruling over the myriad souls
that compose the vast kingdom of the dead. Perched
on the back of the throne is the blinking owl, who
loves this eternal darkness, and the black-winged
raven that was once a bird of snowy plumage and
the favorite messenger of Apollo. The raven fell
from his high estate on account of some unwelcome
tidings that he once brought to Apollo when that
god was an ardent lover of the fair-haired Coronis.
Believing that no one could supplant him in the
maiden's affections, Apollo was happy in the thought
of being beloved by so beautiful a mortal; but
one day his snow-white raven flew in haste to Olympus
to tell him that the maiden was listening to the
wooing of another lover. Enraged at this duplicity,
Apollo seized his bow and shot the faithless Coronis;
but the moment that he saw her lying dead, he repented
of his rash deed and vainly sought to restore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
her to life. Though skilled in the art of healing,
Apollo could not save the maiden; and in his frenzied
grief he cursed the unfortunate raven that had
brought the evil tidings, and banished it forever from
his sight.</p>

<p>Near Pluto's throne are seated the three judges
of Hades (Minos, Rhadamanthus, and Æacus)
who question all souls that are brought across the
river. When they have learned every detail of the
newcomer's past life, they deliver the cowering spirit
into the hands of Themis, the blindfolded goddess
of justice, who weighs impartially the good and bad
deeds in her unerring scales. If the good outweighs
the evil, the soul is led gently to the Elysian Fields;
but if the bad overbalances the good, then the
wretched spirit is driven to Tartarus, there to suffer
for all its wrongdoings in the fires that burn forever
and ever behind the brazen gates. To these gates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
the guilty one is urged by the three <span class="locked">Furies,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></span> whose
snaky hair shakes hideously as they ply their
lashes to goad the shrinking soul to its place of
torment. Sometimes they are joined by Nemesis,
goddess of revenge, who hurries the doomed spirit
over the fiery waters of the Phlegethon with her
merciless whip, and sees that it follows no path but
the one leading to the brazen gates of Tartarus.</p>

<p>As soon as the gates close on the newly-admitted
soul, there is a renewed clamor of voices, while heart-breaking
sighs and groans mingle with the curses of
those who in their misery dare to defy the gods.
And beneath all the awful sounds that greet the listener's
ears, there is an undertone of pitiful wailing like
the sea's "melancholy, long-withdrawing roar" that
seems to come from millions of throats too feeble to
utter a loud cry. The deepest sighs proceed from
the Danaïdes,&mdash;the beautiful daughters of Danaüs,
king of Argos,&mdash;who must forever strive to fill a
bottomless cask with water. They form a sad procession
as, with their urns on their arms, they go
down to the stream to begin their hopeless task, and
then climb wearily up the steep bank to pour the
water into the ever-empty cask. If they pause a
moment, exhausted with fatigue, the whips of some
avenging attendants of Pluto lash them again into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
action. Their punishment is severe, but the crime
for which they are suffering was a dreadful one.
The fifty daughters of Danaüs were once pledged
in marriage to the fifty sons of Ægyptus, brother
of Danaüs; but when the wedding was being
celebrated, their father remembered the words of an
ancient prophecy that said that he would die by the
hand of his son-in-law. Fearing for his life, he confided
to his daughters what the oracle had foretold,
and gave them each a dagger, bidding them slay their
husbands. On the evening of the wedding, when
the sons of Ægyptus were heavy with wine, the
new-made wives stole in upon them and killed them
as they slept. Danaüs then believed himself safe,
until he learned that one of his daughters had spared
her husband out of love for him. This son-in-law
was eager to avenge his brothers' murder, and having
sought out the wicked Danaüs, fulfilled the prophecy
by killing the king with the very dagger intended
for his own death. The gods punished the cruel
daughters&mdash;except Hypermnestra, who had saved
her husband&mdash;by condemning them to labor in
Tartarus at their impossible task.</p>

<p>Near the Danaïdes stands Tantalus, the father of
Niobe, who on earth was a most inhuman and brutal
king. He ill-treated his subjects, defied the gods,
and dared to make his own will the religion of his
kingdom. He boasted that the gods were not so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
omniscient as people were led to believe; and insulted
the immortals by offering them at a banquet
the flesh of his own son Pelops, believing that they
would never learn the truth of this loathsome feast.
But the gods were not deceived, and left the meal
untouched,&mdash;all except poor Ceres, who, still mourning
over her daughter's detention in Hades, did not
realize what was happening and bit off some of the
lad's shoulder. When the gods restored Pelops to
life, Ceres was very sorry for her carelessness and
gave him a shoulder of ivory. The inhuman Tantalus
was condemned to the torments of Tartarus,
where he stands up to his chin in a clear stream.
Though frenzied with thirst he can never drink of
the water, for whenever he bends his head the stream
recedes from his parched lips. Above him hangs a
branch of delicious fruit; but when, tormented with
hunger, he strives to grasp it, the branch eludes his
eager fingers. Thus he stays, always "tantalized"
by the sight of food and drink he never can secure.</p>

<p>Not far from Tantalus is Salmoneus, also a king,
who dared to challenge the gods by impersonating
Jupiter. He made a huge bridge of brass, and
drove heavily over it while he threw lighted torches
among the people who were waiting below, hoping
thus to frighten them into believing that he was the
very ruler of the heavens who hurls the mighty
thunderbolts. This insult to his divinity so angered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
Jupiter that he seized a real thunderbolt and soon
dispatched the arrogant king. When Salmoneus
came before the throne of Pluto, his fate was quickly
decided, and he was driven to terrible Tartarus,
where he sits under a huge rock that threatens every
moment to fall and crush him beneath its weight.</p>

<p>Another unhappy king is Sisyphus, who, when
ruler of Corinth, became a famous robber, and in
the pride of his great wealth dared to set the gods
at naught. Therefore he was consigned to Tartarus,
and his punishment is to roll an immense stone to
the top of a steep hill. As soon as he reaches the
summit, the rock slips from his aching arms and
tumbles to the foot of the hill, and he must at once
start on the hopeless task of pushing it up the long
ascent again.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"With many a weary step, and many a groan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up the high hill he heaves a huge round stone."<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="attrib">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Homer</span>&mdash;Pope's translation.
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Beyond Sisyphus lies Tityus, a giant whose huge
body covers nine acres of ground. He was condemned
to the blackness of Tartarus because he
dared to affront a goddess with his addresses, and
so was doomed to suffer, like Prometheus, by being
chained to a rock, while a vulture tears at his liver.
Near him is Ixion, who was promised the hand of
a certain maiden in marriage, on condition that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
would give her father a large sum of money. Ixion
agreed, but when the maiden became his wife, he
refused to give the stipulated sum, in spite of her
father's clamorous demands. At length, wearied by
the old man's insistence, Ixion slew him; but the
deed did not go unpunished, for the gods summoned
him to appear before them and answer for his cruelty.
Ixion pleaded his cause so well that Jupiter was about
to dismiss him, when he saw the presumptuous mortal
making love to Juno. This offense could not be
overlooked, so Ixion was sent to Tartarus, where
he was bound to an ever-revolving wheel of fire.</p>

<p>If any one could follow the course of the gentle
Lethe River, it would lead beyond the sunless realm
of Pluto to a quiet and far-distant valley, where, in
a soundless cave, live Somnus, the god of sleep, and
his twin brother Mors, god of death. "Here the
sun, whether rising or in his mid course, or setting,
can never come; and fogs, mingled with the dimness,
form a strange twilight. No wakeful bird
calls forth the morn, nor do watchful dogs disturb
the brooding silence. No sound of wild beast or
cattle, nor any noise of creaking bough, nor human
voice, breaks in upon the perfect stillness, where
mute Rest has her abode. Before the cave bloom
abundant poppies and other sleep-producing herbs,
which Night gathers, that she may distil their juice
and scatter slumbers on the darkened earth. Within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
the cave is no door that could creak on rusty hinges,
and no porter stands at the entrance of that inner
room where, on a downy couch made of black ebony
and draped with sable curtains, over which black
plumes wave, lies Somnus, the god of sleep,&mdash;Sleep,
the repose of all things, gentlest of the deities from
whom all care flies, the peace of mind who can sooth
the hearts of men wearied with the toils of the day,
and can refit them for <span class="locked">labor."<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></span></p>

<p>Near Somnus sits Morpheus, one of his many
sons, who watches over his slumbers and sees that
no one shall break in upon his sleep. This god
holds a vase in one hand, and with the other he
shakes the nodding poppies that bring drowsiness
and sleep. Sometimes he assumes varied forms in
which he appears to men at night, and always he
flies through the darkness with wings that make no
noise. Around the couch of Somnus hover shadowy
forms, the <span class="locked">Dreams,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></span> which are as numerous as the
forest leaves or the sands upon the seashore. In a
distant corner of the room lurk the horrid Nightmares,
which creep out of the cave to visit sleeping
mortals, but are never led to earth by Mercury, as
are the welcomed Dreams. Two gates lead out of
the valley of sleep, one of horn and one of ivory.</p>

<p>Mors, god of death, occupies one of the rooms
in the cave of sleep. He is a fearful-looking deity,
cadaverous as a skeleton, and wrapped in a winding
sheet. He holds an hourglass in one hand, and a
sharp scythe in the other; and stands watching the
sand run out of his glass that he may know when a
human life is nearing its end. Then, as the last
grains fall, he glides from the valley of sleep and
stalks silently and unseen upon the earth, where he
cuts down the unhappy mortal, who cannot even hear
the rustle of his garments as he approaches. It is
nothing to him whether the life he takes belongs to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
childhood or youth, for he mows them down as relentlessly
as he does tottering old age. And to the
rich he is as unsparing as to the poor.</p>

<p>The divinities who dwelt in the Cave of Sleep
were distrusted by the ancients, and Mors was held
in universal dread. No homage was ever offered to
him, and no temples were dedicated in his honor;
though sacrifices were sometimes made to ward off
his dreaded coming. He was never represented in
art except in a pleasing aspect, for although they
believed him to have in reality the fearful appearance
that tradition ascribed to him, yet the beauty-loving
Greeks refused to have this kind of horror embodied
in marble. So when Death appears in sculpture, it
is usually with his brother Sleep, and both are represented
as sleeping youths, whose heads are crowned
with poppies or amaranths, and who hold inverted
torches in their listless hands.</p>

his dominion over the waters of the earth. Though
anxious to assert his supreme authority, Neptune
allowed some of the descendants of the Titans to
keep their small kingdoms, on condition that they
own allegiance to him as their ruler. Among these
was Nereus, son of Oceanus, who was celebrated
for his vast knowledge, his gift of prophecy, and
his love of truth and justice. He and his wife
Doris (also a child of Oceanus) had fifty daughters
called <span class="locked">Nereids,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></span> and they were so beautiful that
Neptune chose one of them, named Amphitrite, for
his wife. There were two others of the Nereids
who became famous: Galatea, beloved by the Cyclops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
<span class="locked">Polyphemus,<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span> and Thetis, the mother of Achilles;
but none of them equaled Amphitrite in beauty.</p>

<p>When Neptune first went wooing the Nereid, she
was frightened by his formidable appearance, for he
drove in a chariot drawn by huge sea-horses with
brazen hoofs and golden manes; and the god himself
carried his terrible trident, or three-pronged
spear, with which he shatters rocks, and commands
the storms, and shakes the shores of earth. None
knew better than Amphitrite the extent of Neptune's
power, for she had often watched him, when a storm
was at its height, raise his all-compelling trident, and
immediately the waves would cease raging and there
would be a great calm. Sometimes she saw a ship,
doomed by the sea-god to disaster, gliding confidently
in quiet waters, when all at once a fierce storm would
break over its head; and the hapless sailors, as they
breasted the angry waves, would pray vainly to
Neptune for the help that would never come.
Many a good ship had nearly gained her port when</p>

<p>When Amphitrite saw this imposing-looking god
driving toward her, she was frightened by so much
splendor, though she could not help admiring Neptune
himself with his sea-green beard, and his long
flowing hair crowned with shells and seaweed. Since
the enamored god could never come near enough
to plead his suit, he sent one of his dolphins to do
the wooing; and this was so successful that the fair
Nereid was persuaded to become Neptune's wife,
and share his golden throne in the heart of the sea.
To reward the dolphin for its skill in having won
for him his much-desired bride, Neptune placed it in
the sky, where it forms a well-known constellation.</p>

<p>Though Neptune had undisputed control over
all the waters of the earth, and over all that moves
through the paths of the sea, he once aspired to
greater power, and even plotted to dethrone Jupiter.
But the ruler of gods and men discovered his wicked
plans, and to punish him deprived him of his kingdom
for some years, during which time he was
obliged to submit to the humiliation of serving
Laomedon, king of Troy. It was while he was in
service here that he sought Apollo's help in building
the wall of Troy, whose stones fell into place under
the spell of the sun-god's <span class="locked">music.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></span> Laomedon had
promised Neptune a large reward if the wall was
built within a certain time; but when it was finished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
he refused to pay the sum agreed upon. Though
angered at this treachery, Neptune had to endure
the king's injustice until his years of service were
over; but as soon as he was restored to his former
power, he created a terrible sea-monster, which spread
terror and death over all the land. Not knowing
how to meet this calamity, the Trojans consulted an
oracle, and were advised to sacrifice to the monster a
beautiful maiden each year; and so prevent the
wrath of Neptune from overwhelming the whole
country in disaster.</p>

<p>Reluctantly the sorrowing people prepared to obey
the oracle; and a victim was chosen by lot, and led
by the priest to a large rock on the seashore, where
she was securely chained. Then the hideous sea-beast
glided out of its cave in the slimy rocks and
devoured her. Each year this terrible ceremony was
repeated, and at last the lot fell upon Hesione, the
king's only daughter. Laomedon tried in vain to
save her, but the lot was cast, and nothing could avert
the appointed sacrifice. In despair, the wretched
father saw the fatal hour approaching; and when the
day drew near when Hesione was to be led down to
the sea, he forgot his avarice and proclaimed throughout
the land that a great reward would be given to
any one who could slay the monster. Hercules
appeared just in time to save the doomed maiden,
and killed the monster with his oaken club as it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
dragging Hesione into its cave. The king was
overjoyed at his daughter's rescue, and told Hercules
that he might claim the reward; but even when he
saw the hero come with the beast's head as a proof
that he had slain it, he refused to part with his much-loved
gold. So Hercules returned home, but he did
not forget Laomedon's perfidy; and when later on
he came again to Troy, he killed the king and took
his children captive to <span class="locked">Greece.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></span></p>

<p>Neptune, like all the immortals, loved more than
once; and among those who shared his affections was
a maiden named Theophane, who had so many suitors
that it kept the jealous sea-god in constant fear lest
she should prefer some earthly lover. So he took
her to the island of Crumissa, and there changed her
into a sheep, while he carried on his wooing in the
form of a ram. The offspring of this marriage was
the famous golden-fleeced ram, whose pelt was the
object of that ill-fated expedition made by Jason and
his fellow Argonauts.</p>

<p>Neptune also loved the goddess Ceres, and followed
her during the long time that she spent in
search of her daughter Proserpina. Ceres was angered
by the sea-god's persistent wooing, and hoping
to escape from him, she took the form of a mare;
but Neptune was not so easily discouraged, for he
changed himself into a horse and contentedly trotted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
after her. The child of this strange pair was <span class="locked">Arion,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></span>
a wonderful winged steed that had the power of
speech, and was of such incredible swiftness that
nothing could ever equal it in speed.</p>

<p>The most famous children of Neptune and
Amphitrite were Triton and Proteus. Triton was
his father's trumpeter, and at Neptune's command
he blew upon his conch-shell to calm the restless sea.
His body was half man and half fish, and he gave
the name of Tritons to all his male descendants, who,
with the Nereids and Oceanides (daughters of
Oceanus), followed the chariot of Neptune when he
went abroad to view his kingdom. Proteus had
charge of the great flock of sea-calves which fed on
the soft seaweed and basked in the warm sands near
his cave. He was celebrated for his wisdom and
for the truth of the answers that he gave to those
fortunate enough to make him speak. Homer calls
him "the Ancient of the Deep whose words are ever
true"; but his knowledge was not easy to obtain, for
he had the extraordinary power of assuming any
shape he pleased, and only those mortals gained his
advice who persistently clung to him through his
many bewildering changes.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Aristæus was the son of Apollo, and the water-nymph,
Cyrene. Beside tending his flocks and
herds, he took care of the olive trees and vineyards,
and was a famous keeper of bees. He was very
proud of his hives, and the swarm of bees increased
each year under the guidance of his skillful hands;
but one day he found hundreds of the bees lying
lifeless beside the hives, and on the morrow there
were still more among the dead. Not knowing how
to account for this disaster, Aristæus hurried to his
mother to ask her help in saving the few bees that
remained. Cyrene lived under a mountain stream;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
and, hearing that her son wished to speak to her,
she commanded the river to divide and form a wall
on either side, so that Aristæus might walk in dry
places. When the youth told her of the tragedy
befalling his hives, she could not help him, but bade
him go to old Proteus, for he alone could tell what
the trouble was and find a remedy. She warned
Aristæus of the difficulty in holding the Ancient of
the Deep when he tried to bewilder and terrify the
stranger by rapidly assuming different forms; and
she bade him remember that he must keep the sea-god
fast bound if he would receive the wished-for
answers. Then she led him to the cave of Proteus
and hid him there, exhorting him to be bold and
fearless.</p>

<p>At noon the Wizard of the Deep came up out of
the sea, followed by his herd of sea-calves; and
while they lay stretched out on the warm sands, the
god sought the retreat of his cave and soon was
in a deep slumber. When Aristæus saw Proteus
fast asleep, he stepped cautiously up to him and
bound him with strong fetters. The god woke with
a start, and tried to shake himself free of his chains;
but on finding that he was a prisoner, he resorted to
all the trickery that he could command. He became
a fire, a flood, a wild beast, a horrible serpent,
and many other forms calculated to terrify the beholder.
But Aristæus was not afraid, and soon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
old wizard realized that he must submit; so he assumed
his own shape, and asked the youth what it
was that he wished to know. The son of Cyrene
told him of the death of his bees, and begged for
some remedy. Then Proteus reminded him of how
he had been the real cause of Eurydice's death, by
making her flee from him in such haste that she did
not see the snake at her <span class="locked">feet.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></span> The wood-nymphs,
who were Eurydice's companions, had therefore
wished to punish Aristæus, and had sent this destruction
to his hives. It was necessary to appease
the wrath of the nymphs; and to do this Proteus
bade the youth build four altars, and sacrifice on
them four bulls and four cows of perfect form and
size. This burnt-offering was to placate the nymphs,
and when it was made, he must pay funeral honors
to Orpheus and Eurydice to pacify their anger
against him. At the end of nine days he was to return
to the grove where he had made the sacrifices.</p>

<p>Aristæus thanked the Ancient of the Deep for his
wise words, and after releasing him from the fetters,
hurried away to do as Proteus had advised. The
sacrifices were made, and suitable honors paid to the
dead; and then, after waiting impatiently for nine
days, Aristæus went back to the grove. To his
great joy he found that a swarm of bees had taken
possession of the carcasses, and that he was now the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
owner of a much larger number than he had ever had
before.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>One of the many sea-gods who ruled under Neptune
was Glaucus, who was once a poor fisherman,
and earned his living by selling the fish that he
caught each day. One morning he had an extra
large haul; and when he threw the fish on the
ground beside him, he noticed that they were eagerly
nibbling the grass that grew very thickly in the spot
where he had flung his net. As he stood watching
them, the fish suddenly leaped up from the ground;
and having flopped back into the water, swam away.
Curious to see whether it was the grass that gave
them this extraordinary power, Glaucus chewed a bit
of it himself, and immediately he felt an irresistible
desire to plunge into the sea. Fearlessly he dived
beneath the waves, and soon found no difficulty in
keeping under water, for the ocean seemed now to
be his native element. He saw his beard turning a
lovely sea-green; and he found that his hair, grown
suddenly long and green, was trailing out behind
him. His arms were azure-colored, and his legs
became a fish's tail; but he felt no regrets over losing
his human form, and stayed contentedly in the
ocean. In time Neptune made him one of the
lesser gods, and took him into the friendly fraternity
of the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
As Glaucus was swimming one day near the shore,
he saw a beautiful maiden named Scylla; and fell so
much in love with her that he forgot he was half fish,
and begged her to be his wife. Scylla stared at his
green hair and blue skin, but this did not frighten
her, nor did she wonder at his fish's tail; for she
had often played with the sea-nymphs, and was accustomed
to their strange appearance. Glaucus felt
encouraged by her behavior, and begged her to listen
to the story of his life. He told her how he had
suffered a sea change, and now occupied the lofty
position of a god. The maiden was interested in
this recital, but she had no desire to marry a merman,
even if he were a god; so when Glaucus ventured
to come nearer to her, she turned and fled.
Discouraged but still determined, the young god
sought the aid of the enchantress Circe, and begged
her to give him some love-potion by which he might
win the unwilling Scylla. Circe was so well pleased
with the handsome sea-god that she urged him to
accept her love, and forget the maiden who scorned
him; but Glaucus would not yield to the persuasions
of the enchantress, and kept pleading for the
desired love-potion.</p>

<p>Seeing that she could not gain his affections,
Circe determined that at least no one else should
enjoy his love; so she refused to make the potion,
and sent Glaucus angrily away. When she saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
him go sorrowfully from her palace, she mixed a
magic liquid, brewed from poisonous plants and
deadly weeds, and this she poured over the waters
where Scylla was wont to bathe. The maiden, suspecting
no treachery, sought the ocean at her accustomed
hour, and as soon as the poisoned waves
touched her body she became a horrible monster
with six heads&mdash;each having three rows of sharp
teeth. She saw all around her serpents and barking
dogs that were part of her own body, which had
suddenly become rooted to the spot where she stood.
She never regained her human form, but stayed in
this place forever to terrify all mariners, and to devour
the hapless sailors that came within her reach.
Opposite her was the den of Charybdis, who three
times a day swallowed the waters of the sea, and
three times threw them up again. On the rock
above the den was an immense fir-tree, and all ships
that passed that way watched eagerly for this signal
of danger, and prayed that they might safely steer
between the double horrors of Scylla and Charybdis.</p>

<p>Two other minor deities of the sea were Leucothea
and Palæmon. They were not born of the
ocean-nymphs or any water-god, but were once
mortals, named Ino and Melicertes. Ino was the
wife of King Athamas, whom cruel Juno goaded
into madness; and through fear of him Ino fled
from the palace with her little son, Melicertes, in
her arms. She hoped to reach some place of
safety; but imagining herself pursued, in her frenzy
she plunged from a cliff's edge into the sea. Neither
she nor her son perished, however, for the gods, in
pity for her sufferings, changed them both into
ocean deities under the names of Leucothea and
Palæmon. They were widely worshiped by all
who had business in great waters, and their protection
was invoked against the danger of shipwreck.
A famous altar to Palæmon was built on the shores
of Corinth, and in his honor were instituted the
celebrated Isthmian <span class="locked">games.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Neptune was not only willing to befriend a goddess
in distress, as he did when he raised the island
out of the sea for Latona, but was equally ready to
assist mortals&mdash;especially in their love affairs. Once
he lent his chariot to a youth named Idas when he
wished to elope with the maiden Marpessa, whose
father had refused to allow the lovers to wed. They
were overjoyed at Neptune's kindly offer of assistance;
and on the day arranged for their flight, the
happy pair mounted the chariot, and the swift
steeds carried them far out of reach of Marpessa's
angry father. When he discovered that his daughter
had eloped with her lover, he started in pursuit;
but finding it impossible to overtake Neptune's
splendid horses, he flew into such a rage that he
flung himself into a river and drowned. (The river
was afterwards called by his name&mdash;Evenus.)</p>

<p>Knowing themselves out of reach of the irate
father, the lovers continued their journey very happily,
and believed that no misfortune could overtake
them, when suddenly Apollo appeared before
them, and, declaring himself in love with Marpessa,
offered to fight Idas then and there for the possession
of the maiden. Poor Idas felt that his chances
for happiness were indeed ended, for how could a
mortal contend with an omnipotent god? Suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
a thunderbolt fell from the blue sky, and a
voice declared that Marpessa herself should choose
between her two suitors. The maiden looked at
the glorious sun-god, and her heart beat fast at the
thought of being loved by one so beautiful and
young; but when she turned to Idas, she remembered
that he was a mortal like herself, who would
grow old as she grew old, and would, therefore,
not cast her aside when her youthful charm was
gone, as Apollo would be sure to do as soon as
her beauty waned. So she held out her hand to
Idas, and refused the sun-god's love. This choice
was approved by Jupiter, and the lovers, happy
once more, urged Neptune's swift horses over the
mirror-like sea, which the kindly god had made
calm as a forest pool on the softest summer day.
In time they reached a pleasant land far from their
native country, and here they lived happily ever
afterward. The chariot, no longer needed, was
sent back to Neptune with many thanks for his
timely aid; and each year Idas and Marpessa
burned as sacrifices to their protector a white bull,
a white ram, and a white boar, which was the kind
of offering most pleasing to Neptune.</p>

<span class="subhead">Bacchus</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">Among</span> all the maidens whom Jupiter honored
with his love, none was more beautiful than
Semele, daughter of Cadmus and Harmonia.
Cadmus was the brother of Europa, whom Jupiter,
in the form of a white bull, carried on his back
across the sea. The maiden's three brothers had
been with her in the meadow, and had witnessed her
strange departure, but knowing that it would be
useless to attempt to catch the fleet animal, they
hurried to their father, Agenor, and told him of the
manner in which his favorite daughter had been
spirited away. The old man was frenzied with
grief, and bade his three sons to go in search of
Europa and not return until they had found her.
The youths set out, accompanied by their mother,
Telephassa, and spent many weary days in a fruitless
search for the stolen maiden. At last Phœnix refused
to go any farther, and, not daring to return
to his father, he remained in a land that was afterwards
called in his honor&mdash;Phœnicia. Cilix, the
second brother, grew weary of the hopeless quest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
and settled in a country named from him&mdash;Cilicia;
and finally Telephassa, exhausted by fatigue and
grief, died, and Cadmus was left to continue the
search alone. He kept doggedly on for many days,
and when he reached the town of Delphi, he consulted
the oracle, hoping to find some clew to help
him. To his surprise the oracle gave this ambiguous
answer: "Follow the cow and settle where she
rests." Cadmus left the temple, and before he had
journeyed far he saw a cow walking leisurely in front
of him. Judging this to be the animal intended to
guide him, he followed her, and on the way was
joined by a curious crowd who were eager to see
where the absurd procession would finally stop.
Some hoped that by accompanying the hero on his
march they might meet with new adventures. The
cow at last lay down in Bœotia, and here Cadmus
founded the city of <span class="locked">Thebes.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></span></p>

<p>To reward Cadmus for his loving search for
Europa, Jupiter gave him in marriage the fair
Harmonia, daughter of Mars and Venus. The
child of this union was Semele, whom Jupiter wooed
in the disguise of a mortal; but such was the maiden's
pride that she would not listen to his pleading until
he told her who he really was. Then her love was
easily won, for no pride could be above yielding to
the ruler of Olympus. Jupiter was very happy in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
the society of Semele, and went down to earth many
times to visit her, but it was inevitable that Juno
should notice his frequent absences, and should set
about finding out where the charm lay that lured
him so often to the earth. When she discovered
her beautiful rival, she decided upon an ingenious
method of punishing her, and accordingly took the
form of Semele's old nurse, Beroë. By feigning a
loving solicitude for her charge's welfare, she soon
won the confidence of the unsuspecting maiden, and
listened with well-concealed anger while Semele
talked of her lover and showed her pride in having
won the affections of the greatest of gods.</p>

<p>The nurse was evidently delighted at Semele's
happiness, but seemed worried over the new suitor's
identity, and now and then expressed a doubt as to
whether he really was the great Jupiter. On questioning
the maiden more closely, she assumed a
virtuous indignation when Semele admitted that her
lover always visited her in the disguise of a mortal,
and that she had only his word as proof of his
divinity. Hearing this, the old woman urged Semele
to make sure that it was no impostor who was playing
on her credulity, and pricked the girl's pride by
asking her why it was that Jupiter&mdash;if it were indeed
he&mdash;should not honor her as he did the stately
Juno by appearing before her in all his splendid
majesty. Then the pretended nurse described the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
glory of Jupiter as it was seen by the dwellers in
Olympus, and finally so worked upon Semele's
pride and curiosity that the unsuspicious maiden
promised to put her lover to the test. So when
Jupiter came again, she begged him to grant her a
favor, and the ruler of the gods, not knowing of
Juno's wiles, readily promised to grant any request
Semele might make. To further bind himself, he
swore by the river Styx&mdash;the most terrible of all
oaths. Then the maiden bade him return to
Olympus, clothe himself in all his regal apparel&mdash;omitting
no part of his terrible splendor, not even
the dreaded thunderbolts&mdash;and having done this,
return to her, that she might know he was indeed
the awful Thunderer.</p>

<p>Jupiter was dismayed at this request, for he knew
that no mortal could endure the greatness of his
glory. He begged Semele to ask another boon;
but the maiden was obstinate, and insisted upon her
request being granted. Sorrowfully Jupiter returned
to Olympus, and after robing himself in his fearful
majesty, he dimmed the radiance wherever he could,
wrapped about him the mildest lightning, and took
in his hand the feeblest thunderbolt.</p>

<p>But in spite of his attempt to lessen his splendor,
even this mild glory so overwhelmed poor Semele
that when Jupiter appeared before her, she dropped
dead at his feet. In trying vainly to bring her back
to life, Jupiter did not notice what havoc the lightning,
that played about his head, was making in the
palace. In a short time the whole place was reduced
to ashes, and in the smouldering ruins the body of
Semele was consumed. The only person who escaped
uninjured was the infant son of Jupiter and
Semele, the golden-haired <span class="locked">Bacchus.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></span></p>

<p>Having rescued his son from the burning palace,
Jupiter first intrusted him to his aunt Ino, who
cared for him as tenderly as if he were her own child.
But the jealous hatred of Juno was not satisfied with
the death of Semele, and she tried to extend her
vengeance to Bacchus by sending the fury Tisiphone
to goad Athamas, the husband of Ino, into madness.
As king of Thebes, Athamas had always been a
kind ruler, but when the frenzy, inspired by cruel
Juno, took possession of him, he imagined that his
wife and children were wild beasts, and attempted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
to kill them. He did succeed in slaying Learchus,
but Ino and her other son, Melicertes, escaped from
his murderous fury, and afterwards became deities
of the <span class="locked">ocean.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></span></p>

<p>Not daring to leave the infant Bacchus in such a
household, and fearing the further persecutions of
Juno, Jupiter took the boy to Mount Nysa, where
the nymphs&mdash;the Nysiades&mdash;guarded him faithfully.
During his youth, Bacchus was made god of
wine and revels, and was intrusted to the tutorship of
Silenus, one of the most famous of the satyrs. This
jovial old man had a bald head, pointed ears, a fat
red face, and a body that was half man and half
goat. As he carried a wine bag with him wherever
he went, he was generally tipsy, and would have broken
his neck long before reaching old age if he had
tried to walk unsupported; but some of Bacchus's
chosen band of followers always held him up on
either side; or, when they themselves were unsteady,
set him on an ass's back. Thus protected, he roamed
about with Bacchus, and taught him all the craft
of wine-growing and the making of choicest wine.
The young god soon became a master of revels, and
had a large train of followers composed of men and
women, nymphs, fauns, and satyrs. They were
usually crowned with ivy leaves, and were always
drinking wine, eating grapes, singing, and dancing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
The most unruly among them were the Bacchantes,
who, though women, were often so crazed with wine
and the excitement of their dancing that they committed
such inhuman crimes as tearing the musician
Orpheus to <span class="locked">pieces.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></span> Wherever Bacchus traveled&mdash;and
it was far and wide&mdash;he taught the people the
art of cultivating grapes and making wine. He was
always welcomed, and when they knew he was approaching,
men, women, and children flocked to
meet him and his merry company.</p>

<p>Juno tried hard to check his triumphant progress,
but she did not dare take his life for fear of Jupiter's
wrath; so she afflicted him with a kind of madness
that drove him forth a wanderer alone over the
earth. He had many adventures during this unhappy
period, and finally landed in Phrygia, where
the goddess Rhea cured him and taught him her
religious rites. After this he wandered in Asia and
India, teaching the people the wonderful new art of
making wine. When he returned to Greece, he was
welcomed everywhere, until he reached his native
city of Thebes, where his cousin Pentheus was king.
When Pentheus heard that the people were flocking
out of the gates to meet Bacchus and his revelers,
he tried to stop the excited crowds and force them
to return. In vain he pleaded, commanded, threatened.
Men and women, and even children, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
eager to join in the revels, and would not turn back.
Then Pentheus sent some of his servants to seize
Bacchus and bring him a prisoner to the city.
Soon the messengers returned, but they had not
succeeded in getting near the god&mdash;so great was the
crowd that pressed eagerly around him. They had,
however, captured one of his followers; and when
they dragged their prisoner before the king, he
stood in the presence of the angry monarch without
any sign of fear in his calm face. Pentheus commanded
the man to tell what sort of revelry and rites
were performed under the leadership of Bacchus; and
threatened to put him instantly to death if he did not
tell the truth. The prisoner smiled at the king's
anger, and seemed quite undisturbed by the threats
against his life. He refused to tell anything of the
ceremonies attending the worship of Bacchus, but
began calmly to relate his own story.</p>

<p>He said that his name was Acetes of Mæonia,
and that he was a poor fisherman by birth, but had
himself learned the pilot's art of steering by the
stars. He had thus become master of a cruising vessel;
and once, when he was near the island of <span class="locked">Dia,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></span>
he sent some of his men to shore for fresh water.
They soon returned, bringing with them a youth
whom they had found asleep in the forest, and had
captured, hoping to obtain a large ransom for him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
as the lad was surely some king's son&mdash;so haughty
and regal was his bearing. When Acetes saw the
youth, he begged his men not to force him on board
the ship, for the pilot felt convinced that it was no
mere mortal who stood so proudly before them.
But the sailors would not listen to his advice, and
thrust the youth roughly on board. Then Acetes
refused to steer the ship; but the men only laughed
and declared that they could pilot the craft as well
as he. An angry discussion took place on the
decks, and soon the quarreling grew so loud that
the captured youth, who had been gazing listlessly
over the sea, turned to the wrangling crew and asked
in what direction the ship was sailing.</p>

<p>"We will steer wherever you wish to go," replied
one of the men with a wink at his companions.</p>

<p>"Then sail back to Naxos, for that is my home,"
said the youth. The sailors promised to do so, but
turned the ship toward Egypt, where they hoped to
sell their prize for a large sum in gold. Acetes
made several brave attempts to get possession of
the helm and steer for Naxos, but the sailors struck
him down, and threatened to throw him overboard
if he interfered in their plans.</p>

<p>Soon the lad seemed to notice that the familiar
shores were receding, and anxiously inquired if they
were really sailing toward Naxos. He begged them
not to ill-treat a friendless boy; but to let him return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
home in safety. Then the crew, weary of their
pretense, told him brutally that he was being taken
to Egypt to be sold as a slave; and that he could
try his pretty speeches on his future master. The
youth did not reply to these taunts, but looked
calmly at the jeering sailors, and raised his hand
above his head. Immediately the ship stopped as
if it had been suddenly rooted to the sea; and
though the men pulled frantically at the oars, not
an inch could the vessel move. Then, as in a
dream, they saw ivy twining rapidly about the sails,
and wrapping the oars in its strong tendrils. A
vine with its heavy clusters of grapes clung to the
mast and the sides of the ship. There was the
delicious smell of crushed fruit in the air, and
the fragrance of new-made wine.</p>

<p>The sailors stared at the transformed ship and at
the captured youth, who now shook off his mask
of simplicity and appeared before them in all his
godlike beauty&mdash;for it was no other than the divine
Bacchus whom they had derided and had hoped to
sell as a slave. The sound of flutes was heard all
around him, and the shrill notes of the pipes. At
the feet of Bacchus crouched tigers, lynxes, and
panthers, and the god himself bore in his hand a
staff wreathed with ivy. Then terror seized the
trembling sailors, and they sprang madly over the
side of the ship; but as soon as they touched the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
water they were changed into dolphins. Only
Acetes was left standing on the deck before the
smiling Bacchus, who bade him have no fear, but
take the helm and steer straight for Naxos. The
pilot gladly obeyed, and soon reached the desired
port, where he left his ship and became a follower
of the god of wine.</p>

<p>When Acetes finished this remarkable story, King
Pentheus swore that not a word of it was true, and
ordered his prisoner to be taken away at once and
executed. The soldiers threw Acetes into a dungeon;
but while the preparations for his execution were
being made, his chains suddenly dropped off and
his prison doors flew open. When the jailers came
to lead him to his death, he was nowhere to be
found. Meanwhile the king had learned that the
people were thronging around Bacchus on the
Cithæron mountain, just outside the city, and were
eagerly joining in all the joyous rites that attended
the worship of the god of wine. The shouts of the
Bacchanals filled the air, and in spite of his anger
against them, Pentheus was curious to see what these
ceremonies were that occasioned such roisterous
mirth. So he disguised himself as a beggar, and
joined the shouting crowd that surrounded Bacchus
and his followers. The noisiest of the revelers were
the Bacchantes, who danced and sang in a very
frenzy of excitement as they tossed their ivy wreaths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
into the air and poured the red wine recklessly upon
the ground. When this group, flushed with wine
and half clad, whirled madly toward him, the king
was astonished to see among them his own mother
Agave. As he leaned nearer to the shouting
dancers, wondering how his mother came to join in
such orgies, she suddenly saw him, and pointing a
finger at his shrinking figure <span class="locked">cried:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"There is the monster who prowls in our woods.
Come on, sisters. I will be the first to strike the
wild boar." Blinded by the madness that Bacchus
had purposely inspired, she rushed upon the terrified
king, followed by the crowd of half-crazed Bacchantes.
In vain did Pentheus cry out that he was her son.
Agave and her companions trampled him down in
their fierce onslaught, and in a moment tore him
to pieces. Thus was the worship of Bacchus established
in Greece.</p>

<p>The spot that the god of wine loved best was the
island of Naxos; and here he spent much of his
time when he was not wandering over the earth to
teach the art of making wine. One day Bacchus
was walking on the seashore with his ivy-crowned
company, who followed him singing and dancing to
the music of their shrill pipes. As they neared a
spot where the rocks rise like a cliff above the
water's edge, they discovered a maiden sitting on
the white sand. This was Ariadne, who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
deserted by her lover, <span class="locked">Theseus,<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></span> and left to pine
away alone on the island. For days Ariadne had sat
looking mournfully out over the sea; and now when
Bacchus, with his joyous group of revelers, suddenly
broke in upon the silence of her solitude, she was
frightened by the sight of so many strangers. Bacchus
soothed her fears, and in a short time so won
the maiden's confidence that he persuaded her to
become his wife. Ariadne was quite content to stay
on the island with such a merry company, and if she
ever felt any regret over the faithless Theseus, it was
soon forgotten in the joy of the wedding celebrations,
which lasted for several days. As a marriage gift,
Bacchus placed on Ariadne's white forehead a crown
adorned with seven glittering stars; but wonderful
as it was, it did not eclipse the beauty of the wearer.
The happiness of the newly-wedded pair did not last
long, however, for in a few months Ariadne sickened
and died. After her death Bacchus left the island,
and did not return there for many years; but before
he set sail he took Ariadne's crown and threw it up
into the sky, where it forms a brilliant constellation
known as Corona.</p>

<p>One day Silenus fell asleep in the forest, and his
companions, believing him safe for a while, went
away and left him propped up against a tree with
his wine-bag at his side. Here he was found by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
some peasants, who were subjects of Midas, king of
Lydia. The rustics watched the sleeping Silenus
for a long time, wondering who he might be. At
length the old man woke up, and after rubbing his
eyes, asked the staring peasants where he was. As
he received no answer to his question, Silenus
motioned to the rustics to help him up, and then
started to hunt for Bacchus and his lost companions.
Seeing him unable to walk the men led him to the
court of King Midas who, as soon as he saw the
wanderer's jolly red face and his body&mdash;half goat
and half man&mdash;knew at once that it was Silenus, the
tutor of Bacchus. This Midas was the same king
who had challenged Apollo to compete in the musical
contest with Pan; and, because of his unfair decision,
had been cursed with ass's ears by the offended <span class="locked">god.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></span>
The fact that Silenus had ears unlike the average
mortal may have made King Midas feel a bit more
sympathy for the old man's distress; but whatever
the reason might be, he entertained Silenus royally
for ten days, and then led him back to his pupil,
who had been wondering at his long <span class="locked">absence.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></span></p>

<p>Delighted to have Silenus returned to him unharmed,
Bacchus promised to give the king any
reward he might name; and Midas, being very
avaricious, asked the god to grant that all that he
touched should turn into gold. Bacchus had hoped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
that Midas would desire a better gift than this; but
having made a promise, the god was ready to fulfill
it, and he therefore assured the king that his wish
was granted. Midas, overjoyed at his good fortune,
hastened back to his palace, and on the way he
hesitatingly tried his new power. He touched some
leaves that hung from the trees near by, and immediately
they became golden. He took up a stone
from the roadway, and it turned into gold in his hand.
He plucked an apple, and in a moment it looked
like one of the golden fruit from the garden of the
Hesperides. Midas was almost beside himself with
joy; and as soon as he reached his palace he began
at once to turn all its furnishings into gold. He
was so delighted with his wonderful gift that he felt
no desire to eat or drink or rest; but at last he grew
a little weary of turning things into gold, and, being
hungry, sat down at his well-filled table.</p>

<p>He took great pleasure in seeing the cloth and
the cups and the plates change as everything else
had done at his touch; but to his great amazement
and horror, he also found that the bread he took in
his hand, the food that touched his lips, turned into
hard, unyielding gold. He tried to drink from the
shining cups, but the wine in his mouth became
melted gold. Then Midas knew the real meaning
of his magic touch, and realized sorrowfully that
until it was taken away, he would slowly starve in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
the midst of his great wealth. Already he hated
his gift, and longed for some way to divest himself
of his ill-fated power. He cried aloud to Bacchus
for help, but no answer came to his prayers. Again
he besought the god, and this time acknowledged his
avarice, and lamented the greed that had led him to
ask for the gift of the golden touch. Bacchus heard
his prayers, and, believing him truly repentant,
commanded him to go to the river Pactolus, trace
the stream to its source, and plunge his head and
body into the purifying water. In this way he
could cleanse himself of his fault and its punishment.
Midas did as he was instructed, and came away from
the river a wiser and happier, though a poorer man.
If at any time he was ever tempted to regret his lost
gift, he had only to look into the river at the glittering
golden sand on the bed of the stream; for where
the king had stood, the sand was changed into gold,
and so it has remained to this very <span class="locked">day.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></span></p>

<span class="subhead">Pan and the Nymphs</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Pan</span>,<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> the god of woods and fields, god of the
flocks and herds, and patron deity of all shepherds,
was said to be the son of Mercury. It
is apparently not known who his mother was, but
she must have had some sylvan blood in her veins,
for the youthful Pan showed every evidence of
having been born of woodland creatures, as he
had the pointed ears of the fauns, and the horns
and goat's legs of the satyrs. The story goes that
his mother&mdash;whichever nymph it was of the many
reputed to have borne him&mdash;was disgusted with
his absurd appearance, and refused to own him for
her child; but Mercury was delighted with his
son's grotesque figure, and took him to Olympus
to amuse the gods.</p>

<p>Pan's favorite dwelling place was Arcadia; and
here he wandered over the hills and among the
rocks, or roamed through the fertile valleys. He
delighted in hunting, and amused himself with
various pastimes&mdash;his especial pleasure being to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
lead in the dances with the nymphs. He was
devoted to music, and was usually seen playing
on the syrinx,&mdash;or shepherd's pipes,&mdash;which he
himself invented and named from a nymph whom
he unsuccessfully wooed. The maiden Syrinx was
a follower of Diana; and one day, as she was returning
from the chase, she met Pan, who immediately
fell in love with her beauty, and begged her
to be his wife. The nymph had always scorned
to listen to any lover, and Pan's appearance did
not tend to soften her objections; so while he was
praising her many charms and pleading for her love,
she turned and ran away. The woodland god was
not to be put off so lightly, however; and he
promptly gave chase to the fleeing maiden, who,
finding that her pursuer was gaining on her, called
wildly on the river-nymphs for help. She had by
this time reached the water's edge; and just as
Pan's arms were about to enfold her, the kindly
nymphs changed her into a cluster of reeds. The
god was much chagrined at the failure of his hopes;
but since he could not have the living maiden,
he determined to take whatever remained of the
beautiful thing that had charmed him. So he
gathered a bunch of the reeds, and after cutting
them into unequal lengths, bound them together
into a sort of shepherd's pipes. When he put the
reeds to his lips, they gave forth the softest and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
most plaintive tones, and Pan called them the
syrinx in honor of the nymph.</p>

<p>Before inventing this new instrument, Pan had
played upon the flute, and it was his skill in this
direction that made King Midas dare to affront
Apollo by declaring Pan to be the better musician.
The god of woods and fields was not, however,
a frequenter of palaces, but made his home in
grottoes and piped to the murmuring trees. He
loved to prowl by night in lonesome places, and
lurk among the shadows where some belated traveler,
startled by the weird hoot of an owl, would
see his grotesque form and rush away, filled with
that unreasoning terror called a "panic." Pan's
partners in the sylvan dance were the wood-nymphs,
who always welcomed him and his followers. When
his days were spent among the mountain solitudes,
the Oreads, or mountain nymphs, danced with him
in the moonlight; and when he preferred to live in
the valleys, the Dryads, or nymphs of vegetation,
joined in the revels led by Pan and his company
of fauns and <span class="locked">satyrs.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></span> The Naides, the beautiful
water-nymphs who dwelt in the clear depths of the
fountains, did not come out of their quiet haunts
to take part in the merriment; nor did the shy
Hamadryads leave the safe shelter of their trees
to mingle in the joyous dance. Among these latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
nymphs each had her particular tree, and lived and
died with the one intrusted to her care. It was
held, therefore, to be an act of wanton cruelty to
destroy or even mar a tree, lest the Hamadryad
who inhabited it should be hurt and possibly killed.
It was unwise to break off a flower recklessly, or
to pull it rudely from the earth, for in this humble
form might be lodged the spirit of some woodland
creature.</p>

<p>Such a sad mistake did Dryope once make, and
suffered for her carelessness by being changed from
a mortal into a Hamadryad. Dryope was a beautiful
young princess, the wife of Andræmon, and
the mother of a golden-haired boy. Every day
she carried her child to a small lake near the palace,
and let him gather the gayly-colored flowers that
grew on the water's edge. One day, as she wandered
by the lake, Dryope saw a lotus blossom
and pointed it out to her little son, who immediately
tried to pluck it. As it was much beyond his
reach, his mother leaned over the water and broke
it off the stem. To her surprise, she saw drops
of blood slowly oozing from the stem; and as the
boy eagerly grasped the lovely flower in his chubby
hand, a crimson stream trickled through his clasped
fingers. He dropped the blossom with a frightened
cry, and ran screaming to the palace, while Dryope
stood looking down, bewildered, at the bleeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
flower. Just then she heard a voice telling her
that she had killed the nymph Lotis, who, to escape
from the arms of the hateful god Priapus, had taken
the form of a lotus.</p>

<p>When Dryope realized the dreadful thing that
she had unknowingly done, she turned pale with
fright, and would have hurried away from the unlucky
spot; but when she tried to turn from the
sight of the dying flower, she found that she could
not move. Her feet seemed rooted to the ground;
and, as she looked down, she was horrified to see
that a rough bark was beginning to inclose her
limbs. With dreadful rapidity it spread upward,
and soon encircled her whole body, while her arms
changed into twisted branches and her hands into
green leaves. In vain she called to her husband
and her friends for help. When they arrived, there
was nothing left of the fair Dryope but her tear-stained
face, which was covered all too soon by
the cruel bark. Just before she disappeared completely
from their sight, she begged that her little
son might be taught to play beneath her branches;
and when, in all the after days, the boy sat willingly
beside the tree and listened to the soft rustling of
its leaves, the passers-by would say: "Dryope is
whispering to her <span class="locked">child."<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></span></p>

<p>The danger of recklessly destroying any tree is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
shown by the story of Erysichthon, who dared to
defy the goddess Ceres, and so received a fitting
punishment. There was a certain grove of trees
sacred to Ceres, and among them was a lofty oak
on which votive tablets were often hung, and around
which the nymphs and Dryads danced hand in
hand. Erysichthon ordered his servants to cut
down this venerable oak; and when they hesitated,
telling him that it was a tree beloved by Ceres and
should not suffer such a sacrilege, he seized the ax
himself and made a deep gash in the trunk. To
the great horror of those who stood by, blood began
to flow from the wound; and as Erysichthon
was about to deal the tree another blow, one of his
servants caught at his arm, imploring him not to
touch the oak again, for the blood showed that a
Hamadryad was being wounded. Maddened at
this interference, and determined to carry out his
brutal will, Erysichthon declared that he would cut
down the tree if by so doing he killed a dozen
Dryads. He lifted his ax for a mighty stroke, and as
the servant again sought to stay his arm, he turned
fiercely and killed the man with one swift blow.
Then he proceeded to fell the tree, and soon it
was lying, bruised and bleeding, on the ground.</p>

<p>The nymphs rushed to Ceres, and begged her to
punish this wicked violation of her grove. The
goddess promised that Erysichthon's deed should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
not go unpunished, and sent an Oread to the
remote part of Scythia, where the ice lies thick
on the dreary soil and the land is always desolate.
"Here dwell drowsy Cold and Paleness and Shuddering
and dreadful Famine." When the Oread
drew near this barren country, she saw far off the
gaunt form of Famine pulling up with her teeth
and claws the scant bits of vegetation that could be
found here and there in the frozen earth. The
nymph did not want to linger near the dreadful
form of Famine, lest the hag should reach out her
lean finger and touch the maiden's robes; so she
hurriedly delivered the message of Ceres, and sped
quickly back to her own fair land of Thessaly.</p>

<p>Not daring to disobey the goddess's command,
Famine left her dreary country and sought out
the home of Erysichthon. She found him asleep;
and as he slept she enfolded him with her wings,
and breathed into his nostrils her deadly breath.
Then she returned to her frantic digging in the unyielding
soil. When Erysichthon awoke, he was at
once consumed with a fierce desire for food; but,
however much he ate, the terrible craving never
ceased. All day long he devoured things greedily,
but at night his hunger was still unsatisfied. His
servants piled up food in enormous quantities before
him, but the gnawing pangs of hunger never
left him. He spent all his wealth in a vain attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
to buy enough food to appease the insatiable monster
within him; but, though he at last sold all that
he had, even to his house and his clothing, it was
not enough to buy him the food he craved. There
was nothing left him now but his daughter; and
frenzied by his hunger, he offered to sell her to a
slave-dealer.</p>

<p>The girl pitied her father's sufferings and would
have done anything to help him; but she resented his
baseness in selling her, for she came of a noble race.
While her purchaser was disputing with her father
over the price, the maiden, who was standing on the
seashore, a short distance away from her new master,
implored Neptune to save her from the disgrace of
being sold as a slave. The kindly sea-god heard
her cry, and changed her into an old fisherwoman.
When the bargain between Erysichthon and the
dealer was settled, the man looked around for his
new purchase, but she was nowhere to be seen. The
only person on the seashore, beside the brutal bargainers,
was an old woman who sat mending her
net. The irate owner searched in vain for his slave
and even asked the fisherwoman if she had seen a
weeping maiden. Unable to find the girl, he at last
went away, concluding that Erysichthon's daughter
had tried to escape and so had been drowned in the
sea. The maiden was rejoiced at her deliverance;
but her cruel father, on seeing her regain her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
form, decided that this was an easy way of making
the money he desperately needed. So he sold his
daughter again and again, and each time she sought
the help of Neptune, who obligingly turned her
into many different shapes. At last even this device
failed to bring to Erysichthon enough money
to meet the ever increasing demands of his hunger.
In despair over the lack of food he began to eat his
own flesh; and in a short time he had devoured so
much of his body that death came to end his torment.
So was Ceres avenged.</p>

<p>The Hamadryads were seldom seen by men, but
people knew them to be both gentle and beautiful.
That they could repay a kindness is well shown by
the story of Rhœcus, who gained the love of one of
the shyest of these nymphs. One day the youth
happened to see an oak-tree bent so far down by
the wind that some of its branches were already
broken. He propped up the tree, and gently
bound up the broken limbs; then as he turned to
go, he heard a soft voice calling him. It was the
Hamadryad who had expected to die with her
stricken tree, and was now so grateful to Rhœcus
that she bade him ask of her any reward he wished.
The youth boldly asked for her love, and the nymph
reluctantly yielded to his wish, promising to meet
him at the oak-tree each day just before sunset. To
keep him mindful of the hour set for the tryst, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
told him that she would send him a messenger&mdash;a
bee&mdash;which would also guide him to the spot
where she was waiting.</p>

<p>Rhœcus was very happy with the Hamadryad;
and never failed to follow the flight of the bee that
came each day at sunset to lead him to the trysting-place.
One morning, however, he began to play at
dice with his friends, and the game continued through
the long summer afternoon. As it drew toward sunset,
Rhœcus forgot that it was his hour to meet the
Dryad, and continued his game, even though he
noticed vaguely that a bee was buzzing near him.
Soon the bee came close to his face, and buzzed so
persistently that Rhœcus brushed it angrily away.
Each time he tried to shake it off it came buzzing
back, and at last he struck at it so viciously that it
fell to the ground. Then in a flash Rhœcus remembered
his promise to the Dryad, and throwing
away his dice, he hurried to the trysting-place.
He called to the nymph and begged her to come to
him once more; but no sweet face appeared though
a voice spoke from the heart of the oak-tree bidding
him a sad farewell. Rhœcus had already repented
bitterly of his forgetfulness; but nothing could
restore him to favor. He sat all night beside the
oak-tree, but the Dryad never came to him <span class="locked">again.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></span></p>

<span class="subhead">The Vestals</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Vesta</span> was the oldest child of Saturn and
Rhea, and was the goddess of the family
hearth. As the hearth was the basis of all
domestic ties, Vesta was considered the guardian of
family happiness, and her worship was an essential
part of the family life. The hearth in ancient days
had a much greater significance than in modern
times, for it was the center of the household, around
which the family gathered for their common meal
and common worship. On the hearth, as an altar-fire,
the head of the household offered prayers and
sacrifices; and it made a bond of union so generally
recognized that he who partook of food there, or who
shared in the family worship, could ever afterward
lay claim to the master's hospitality. If a suppliant
was seeking protection from any danger, it was to a
man's hearth that he came as a sure place of refuge.
The flames that burned on this family altar were
sacred to the goddess Vesta, and prayers for domestic
happiness and the household's welfare were
usually offered to her. Thus the fire burning on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
the hearth of each dwelling was a perpetual worship
of the beneficent Vesta, and even the sacrifices made
to other gods were partly in her honor; for whenever
the flames were rekindled, a prayer was offered
to the goddess of the family fireside.</p>

<p>Every dwelling was, therefore, in some sense, a temple
of Vesta; but there was also in each city a stately
edifice where all the citizens worshiped at her sacred
fire, and were thus bound together in one great family.
In Rome, where the worship of Vesta was most
celebrated, a beautiful circular temple, dedicated to
the goddess, stood in the Forum. It was not necessary
to place a statue of Vesta here, for the eternal
fire that glowed on her altar was her living symbol,
and through this she was worshiped. This fire
was supposed to have been brought to Italy by
Æneas when he fled from burning Troy and carried
with him out of the city two valuable possessions,
<i>i.e.</i> the fire of Vesta and his own household
gods&mdash;or Penates. When a colony was sent out
from any city, the emigrants took some of the fire
from the temple of Vesta in the mother town, and
guarded it during their voyages, that they might use
its flames to light the fires that were to burn on the
hearths of the new homes. Each city cherished
carefully the fire that was sacred to Vesta, and never
allowed it to burn out, for that was an evil omen
sure to presage disaster. If by any chance it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
allowed to become extinct, it was never relit from any
ordinary fire, but was kindled with a spark produced
by friction, or by drawing fire from the sun's rays
through a glass.</p>

<p>The temple at Rome was the most famous of
those dedicated to Vesta, for here was the school of
the Vestal Virgins whose duty it was to tend her
ever-living fire. As any neglect on their part
might bring some public calamity upon Rome, this
altar was jealously guarded; and when, as it sometimes
happened, enemies threatened the city, the
Vestals carried the fire of Vesta down the Tiber and
kept it in concealment until the danger was over.
Since so much depended on the watchfulness and
fidelity of the Vestals, the office of priestess to the
temple was held in high honor, and the maidens
were chosen from the noblest families of Rome.
They entered the service at the very youthful age
of six, and spent thirty years in the temple. The
first ten years were devoted to learning their important
duties; the next decade was the period for filling
the office of priestess, and performing all the solemn
rites that belonged to the worship of Vesta; the last
ten years were given to instructing the novices.
When the thirty years of service were over, the
Vestals could continue in the temple, or leave it and
marry if they desired; but so holy were the Virgins
thought to become through their long residence in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
the temple, that it was held a sort of sacrilege for
any man to marry them. Therefore the priestesses
usually died, as they had lived, in the service of
the goddess.</p>

<p>The chief duty of the Vestals was to watch in
turns, by night and day, the sacred fire of Vesta, and
to see that the flames never grew dim. During
their entire period of service, they were obliged to
keep the strictest vows of chastity, under penalty of
being buried alive in a vaulted room, built especially
for this purpose by the king, Numa Pompilius.
The Vestals, were, however, so true to all the vows
made at the great altar-fire, that in a thousand
years only eighteen failed in their promises and thus
suffered punishment. The story is told that the
Vestal Tuccia was accused of having broken her
vow, but was able to prove her purity, by being
given the miraculous power to carry water in a sieve
from the Tiber to the temple.</p>

<div id="ip_196" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/i196.jpg" width="600" height="303" alt="" /><div class="caption">Tuccia</div></div>

<p>Though the restrictions placed upon the Vestals
were severe, and the rules of their order were pitilessly
enforced, yet the privileges that they enjoyed
were such as to raise them in dignity above the
other women of Rome. They were entirely released
from all parental authority; they had conspicuous
places at the theaters and gladiatorial shows,
and occupied seats of honor at all public festivals.
Treaties and important state documents were intrusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
to their care as in a place inviolable; and
their persons were held so holy that, when they died,
they were buried within the city limits&mdash;a privilege
granted to but few. When they went abroad, each
was preceded by a lictor; and consuls, prætors, and
even tribunes made way for them, while if any one
passed under their litter, he was put to death. If
they chanced to meet a criminal on his way to punishment,
they could demand his release, provided
that it could be proved that the meeting was accidental.
The Vestals wore a robe of pure white
linen with a wide purple border, and over their
shoulders was a purple mantle. When the festivals
of Vesta, the Vestalia, were held, the priestesses
marched in a procession through the streets, carrying
their sacred fire, while the Roman matrons followed
them barefooted, chanting hymns in praise of Vesta.
During these ceremonies all work was suspended in
the city, the houses were decked with flowers, and
the beasts used in the procession were wreathed in
garlands; banquets were set out before the houses,
and the people gave themselves up to a gala-day.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>When Æneas fled from burning Troy, and took
with him some of the fire from the temple of Vesta,
as the thing most necessary in the founding of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
new city, he also brought to the shores of Italy his
own household gods&mdash;or Penates&mdash;who presided
over the daily affairs of the household, and were
the guardians of each member of the family on
whose hearth they held the place of honor. The
statues of the Penates were of clay, wax, ivory, silver,
or gold according to the master's wealth, and were
always carried to the new home when the family
changed its dwelling place. When the common
meal was served, a small portion of it was set aside
for the Penates, and a libation of wine was poured
to them on the hearth. In return for this daily
deference, the Penates blessed the household with
happiness and prosperity.</p>

<p>The Lares were also worshiped by the Roman
family, though they were quite unknown to the
Greeks. They were the divinities that preserved
the family unity, and often were a sort of embodiment
of the spirit of its head and founder. The
Lares also guarded the welfare of the city, and presided
over the fortunes of those great groups of
families that were the probable foundation of every
Roman town. Tradition tells us that the Lares
were the two children of Mercury and a beautiful
Naiad named Lara. This nymph was so loquacious
that she talked from morning to night, and was very
fond of prying into other people's affairs, that she
might thereby have some new subjects for conversation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
One day she heard Jupiter making love to a
beautiful wood-nymph, and instead of keeping the
matter discreetly to herself, she hurried off to tell
the whole affair to Juno. This impertinence so angered
Jupiter that he determined to punish her severely
and also to prevent her from doing any more
talebearing; so he had poor Lara's tongue cut off.
Then he summoned Mercury and bade him take the
nymph to Hades, where the sight of her sad face
could never offend his eyes. On the way down to
Pluto's kingdom, Mercury fell in love with his fair
companion; and instead of leading her into Hades,
he took her to a kindlier place, where he soon won
her love and persuaded her to be his wife. The two
children of Mercury and Lara were called Lares,
and to them the Romans paid many honors, reserving
for them a place of honor on the family hearth.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Not</span> far from sunny Sicily and the deep crater
of Etna, in which Vulcan built his glowing
forge, were the Æolian Islands&mdash;now called
Lipari Islands&mdash;where Æolus, god of the winds
and storms, kept his turbulent children. He never
allowed them to roam at will, but held them securely
bound in a great cave, and let them loose one
at a time when they needed exercise or when the
gods demanded their release. Only once were they
allowed to give free play to their boisterous feelings,
and rush over the waters, making havoc everywhere,
and this was when Jupiter sent a deluge upon the
impious earth. Since that time the winds have
never roamed at large, though they always chafe at
being restrained in their narrow prison and long to
break free.</p>

</div>

<p>Æolus wooed and married the dainty Aurora,
goddess of the morning, who bore him his sons, <i>i.e.</i>
Boreas, the north wind; Notus, the south wind;
Eurus, the east wind; and Zephyrus, the soft and
gentle west wind. Sometimes Aurora sought the
services of her children, but they were entirely under
the control of their father Æolus who ruled them
with a strict hand. Sometimes when the stately Juno
sought his assistance, he let the winds sweep over
the calm sea until the waves rose mountain high, for
he was reputed to have received his royal status as
god from Juno's hands, and so was ever anxious to
serve her. Once, at her request, he let loose the
fiercest winds to destroy the ships of Æneas&mdash;that
unfortunate hero who was always being pursued by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
"cruel Juno's unrelenting hate." The goddess was
so eager for his destruction that she went herself
to the cave of the winds, and begged Æolus to
shatter the Trojan ships. So a terrible storm broke
over the sea, and the winds drove the vessels of
Æneas far out of their course, scattering them here
and there, until no two could see each other amid
the fury of the tempest. When Neptune realized
what was happening, he lifted his head above the
white-capped waves and saw the Trojan ships tossed
about and beaten out of their course. As he himself
had given no commands for such a storm, he knew
it was the never-ending hatred of Juno for the
Trojans that had brought about the disaster. But
the sea, and all that therein is, was Neptune's to
control, and he was justly angry with Juno's interference;
so he recalled the winds from their mad
race and bade the storm cease.</p>

<p>Quite differently did Æolus treat another famous
hero, Ulysses, whose ships, on the long homeward
journey, touched at the Lipari Islands. Here the
wanderer was hospitably entertained by Æolus, and
when he set sail again, the kindly god sent the west
wind to blow the ships gently over the sea, while he
shut up the blustering winds in a leather bag and
tied it with a silver string. This bag he gave to
Ulysses, "the sagacious," and bade him keep it
closed until the journey was over. For nine days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
and nights the hero stood at the helm watching,
while the west wind bore the ships along without
the help of oars. At last, exhausted by his long
vigil, Ulysses fell asleep; and the sailors, believing
that the bag contained treasure that King Æolus had
generously given, untied the string and freed the
roistering winds. The ships were now driven hither
and thither by the madly-rushing winds, and were
tossed over the sea far away from the longed-for
Ithaca. Finally they were blown back to the Lipari
Islands, where Æolus received them but coldly, and
refused to help them further. So they turned their
prows once more toward home, and worked wearily
against wind and weather by the slow pull of the
oars.</p>

<p>The Athenians built a temple to Æolus, which is
still extant, and is generally known as the Tower of
the Winds, or the Temple of Æolus. The structure
is hexagonal, and on each side there is a flying
figure of one of the winds. Notus (or Auster), the
south wind, was usually represented by an old
man with dusky wings. He is clad in a black robe,
and his head is covered with clouds, for he sends the
rains and sudden showers. Eurus, the east wind,
was a young man full of impetuous and lively
motion. Corus, the northwest wind, drove clouds
of snow before him, and Boreas was a figure rough
and shivering. Zephyrus had a lapful of flowers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
and was the one wind sent to play among children.
Boreas was the bringer of hail and tempests, and
when he wooed the nymph Orithyia, he sought in
vain to approach her gently, and to breathe his love
softly. But he could not sigh, and his lightest
whisper frightened the maiden by its harshness; so
Boreas gave up attempting to win her by gentle
means and boldly carried her off to his home in the
midst of snow and ice. Their children were Zetes
and Calais&mdash;winged warriors who accompanied the
Argonauts on their famous expedition, and performed
a valuable service in driving away the
<span class="locked">Harpies.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></span></p>

<h3 id="janus">II. Janus</h3>

<p>Janus,<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>&mdash;god of the past, present, and future; of
gates and entrances; of war and peace,&mdash;was said
to be the son of Apollo; but as he is a Roman god,
and entirely unknown to Greek mythology, his ancestry
is a matter of doubt. He presided over the
beginning of everything, and was therefore invoked
first in every undertaking&mdash;even before Jupiter. He
opened the year and the seasons, and the first month
of the year was called after him. He was the porter
of heaven, and in this capacity he was represented as
holding a key in his left hand and a staff or scepter
in his right. On earth he was the guardian deity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
gates, and as such he had always two faces turned in
opposite directions, because every door looks both
ways. Another explanation of his physical duality
is that as god of the past and future he sees what is
behind and what is before. Janus was also considered
an emblem of the sun, and had therefore two
faces, one to look at its rising and one to see its
setting. Sometimes these faces were alike, but
more often they were represented by a white-haired
and white-bearded old man on the one side, and a
smooth-cheeked youth on the other.</p>

<p>At Rome Numa Pompilius is said to have dedicated
to Janus the covered passage&mdash;erroneously called a
temple&mdash;that stood close by the Forum. This was
kept open in times of war and closed in times of
peace; but such was the belligerent nature of the
Romans that the gates were closed but three times
in seven hundred years, and then only for a short
period.</p>

<p>As he was god of all beginnings, the first of every
new year, month, and day was held sacred to Janus,
and special prayers and sacrifices were then offered at
his shrines. When he presides over the year, he is
represented as holding the number three hundred in
one hand and sixty-five in the other. Festivals in
honor of Janus were celebrated on the first day of the
new year, and on this day people exchanged visits,
good wishes, and gifts, which usually consisted of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
sweetmeats and copper coins showing on one side the
double head of Janus. The sacrifices offered to
Janus on New Year's day and at other times of beginnings
were barley, incense, cakes, and wine.</p>

<h3 id="iris">III. Iris and Aurora</h3>

<p>Iris was the special attendant of Juno, and was
often employed as a messenger by both Juno and
Jupiter. In the Iliad she is the swift servant of the
gods; but in the Odyssey it is Mercury who is the
messenger to and from Olympus, and Iris is never
mentioned. Sometimes Iris is described as the rainbow
itself; sometimes the rainbow is only the road
over which she travels, and which therefore vanishes
when it is no longer needed. When Juno sends
Iris to the Cave of Sleep "she assumes her garments
of a thousand colors, and spans the heavens with her
curving arch." As the personification of the rainbow&mdash;that
brilliant phenomenon that vanishes as
quickly as it appears&mdash;Iris might easily be considered
the swift messenger of the gods.</p>

<p>Aurora, rosy-fingered goddess of the dawn, opened
the gates of the morning for the impatient horses of
the sun, who chafed at being held behind the golden
bars until Apollo was ready to start forth on his
daily course, attended by the faithful Hours.
Though Aurora was the wife of Æolus and mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
of the winds, she had the usual weakness of the
deities of Olympus for falling in love with mortals
who won her favor. Thus she became enamored of
the young hunter Cephalus, but was unable to gain
his love, as he himself had already wedded the fair
Procris, one of Diana's nymphs. The happiness
of these lovers was a maddening sight to the jealous
Aurora, and she determined to find some way to
end it. Procris had brought to her husband as a
dowry a hunting dog named Lelaps, who could outrun
the swiftest deer, and a javelin that never missed
its mark. So all day long Cephalus hunted in the
forest, and his long absences gave the malicious
Aurora an excuse for whispering to the young wife
that her husband spend his time in the society of a
wood-nymph. For some time Procris resisted these
suggestions of the goddess; but at last, overcome
by jealousy, she followed Cephalus to the forest to
see who the maiden was that charmed him. At
noonday the weary hunter sought his accustomed
resting place; and as he lay beneath a wide-spreading
tree, he called to the breeze to come and refresh him.
Believing that he referred to some wood-nymph,
Procris sank down among the bushes in a swoon;
and her husband, hearing the leaves rustle suddenly
behind him, hurled his javelin into the thicket, supposing
that some wild beast was crouching near him
ready to spring. To his horror he discovered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
body of Procris; and though he did all that he
could to stanch the wound made by his unerring
spear, his wife died in his arms&mdash;but not before an
explanation had been <span class="locked">given.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></span></p>

<p>Though Aurora had succeeded in separating the
lovers forever, she did not thereby gain the affections
of Cephalus, but was obliged to console herself with
the Trojan prince, Tithonus. She begged Jupiter
to confer upon him the boon of immortal life; but
forgetting that he would sometime grow old, she
neglected to ask for him the greater gift of eternal
youth. For a while she was very happy with her
lover, but as soon as he lost the attractions of youth
she wearied of his company and wished to get rid
of him. She shut him up in a room of her palace,
where his feeble voice could often be heard; and
then, knowing that he would never die, she cruelly
changed him into a <span class="locked">grasshopper.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></span></p>

<p>The son of Aurora and Tithonus was Memnon,
who became king of the Ethiopians, and went with
a band of warriors to help his kindred in the Trojan
war. He fought bravely, but at length met his
death at the hands of Achilles. When he fell on
the battle-field, Aurora commanded her sons, the
winds, to carry his body to the banks of the river
Æsepus in Asia Minor, where a tomb was erected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
to his memory. To honor him further, Jupiter
caused the sparks and cinders from his funeral pyre
to be changed into birds, which divided into two
flocks and fought until they fell into the flames.
Every year, on the anniversary of Memnon's death,
the birds returned to celebrate the funeral rites in
this same strange way. When the flames from the
funeral pyre had burned out, Aurora sat by the
ashes of her son, weeping and mourning his loss;
and the many tears that she shed turned into glistening
dewdrops. In Egypt there were two colossal
statues, one of which was said to be the statue of
Memnon; and tradition tells that when the first rays
of morning fell upon it, it gave forth a sound like the
snapping of harp strings.</p>

<h3 id="flora">IV. Flora, Vertumnus, and Pomona</h3>

<p>Flora, goddess of flowers and of spring, was not
among the deities worshiped in Greece, but was
everywhere honored among the Romans. She was
reputed to have married Zephyrus, the balmy west
wind, and with him she wandered happily over
town and country, distributing her favors with lavish
hand. Though the gentle goddess was universally
beloved, her principal devotees were young girls,
who delighted in keeping her altars decorated with
fruits and garlands of flowers. Her festivals were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
held during the month of May and were called the
Floralia.</p>

<p>Vertumnus and Pomona were also Roman deities
and presided over orchards and gardens. Pomona
was a Hamadryad, and was so devoted to the care
of her trees that she scorned the idea of love. Fauns
and satyrs sought to woo her, and Sylvanus&mdash;a
woodland deity&mdash;tried in vain to approach her.
Even the wily Pan was never able to come near
enough to her to urge his suit, but the youthful god
Vertumnus was not to be discouraged by the nymph's
coldness, and determined to win her for his wife.
Hoping to catch her eyes and so get speech with her,
he assumed various disguises. "How often did he
carry the ears of corn in a basket under the guise of
a hardy reaper. How often he bore a whip in his
sturdy hand so that you would have sworn he had
that instant been unyoking the wearied oxen. Now
he was carrying a ladder, and you would suppose he
was going to gather fruit. Sometimes he was a
soldier with a sword, and sometimes a fisherman, taking
up the <span class="locked">rod."<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></span> But no attractions in the form of
man could induce Pomona to leave her orchard, or to
admit one of the hated beings. At last the resourceful
Vertumnus hit upon the plan that brought him
well-earned success. "Having bound his brows
with a colored cap, leaning on a stick and with white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
hair falling around his temples, he assumed the shape
of an old woman and entered the well-cultivated
<span class="locked">gardens."<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></span> After praising the fruit and flowers, the
pretended old woman began to ask Pomona why she
had persistently remained unwed, and told her how
foolish it was to fly from love. Much to the surprise
of Vertumnus, the maiden seemed to receive
this advice very kindly; and when he went on to
speak of a certain youthful god who had long sought
her love, he was delighted at gaining the confession
from Pomona that she might be willing to listen
to Vertumnus if he came to woo. At this admission
the bold lover threw off his disguise, and claimed
the fulfillment of the maiden's promise.</p>

<span class="subhead">Hercules</span></h2>

<h3>Part I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Hercules</span> was the son of Jupiter and
Alcmene&mdash;a lovely princess, the granddaughter
of Perseus and Andromeda. Juno
hated her as she did all her mortal rivals, and sought
to bring misery and suffering on the unoffending
maiden. When she learned that Hercules, the son
of Alcmene, was born, she sent two immense serpents
with poisonous fangs to attack the child while
he slept. The baby happened to waken just as the
creatures were twining themselves about him; and
grasping their necks in each of his tiny hands, he
strangled them, thus showing from his birth the
wonderful strength that was later to make him a
famous hero. The education of Hercules was
intrusted to Chiron, the most renowned of the
centaurs, who had himself been instructed by
Apollo and Diana in hunting, medicine, music, and
the art of prophecy. The idea of a creature half
man and half horse was not repulsive to the ancients,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
who were too fond of a horse to consider man's
union with him degrading. When Hercules left
the kindly tutelage of Chiron, he set out on his own
adventures, and before he had traveled far he met
two beautiful women, each of whom offered to guide
him on his journey. Kakia (Vice) told him that if
he followed her, he would gain love, riches, and ease;
and Arete (Virtue) promised him honor, bought at
the price of hardship, poverty, and endless toil. For
a while the youthful hero deliberated over the two
very different rewards offered him, and at last he
gave his choice to Arete, who henceforth led him
through many perils, and into labors such as no
man had ever yet <span class="locked">performed.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></span></p>

<div id="ip_212" class="figcenter" style="width: 454px;"><img src="images/i212.jpg" width="454" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">The Infant Hercules</div></div>

<p>Like most heroes, Hercules was a great wanderer;
and on one of his journeys he came to the city of
Thebes, where Creon, the king, entertained him and
showed him so much favor that when Hercules
asked for the hand of Creon's daughter Megara in
marriage, the king gladly gave his consent. The
hero then rested from his wanderings, and spent
many happy years in the society of his wife and
children; but Juno had not forgotten her old hatred
of Alcmene's offspring, and she determined to end
this happiness. So she afflicted Hercules with a
sudden madness; and in his delirium he killed his
wife, and threw his children into the fire. When at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
last he recovered his senses, he suffered terribly over
the thought of the crimes that he had unwittingly
committed, and would have gone off to the mountains
to spend his days in sorrow and remorse, had
not Juno demanded that he should expiate his deeds
of bloodshed. Accordingly she sent Mercury to
lead him from his solitude among the hills and to
take him to his cousin Eurystheus, king of Argos,
whom he was compelled to serve for a whole year.
During this time he performed the twelve great
labors that have made his name famous as the doer
of mighty deeds.</p>

<p>The first task that Eurystheus gave the hero was
to procure the skin of a monstrous lion that inhabited
the Nemean forest. This creature's frequent
attacks had brought terror to all the countryside,
for it was not content with carrying off cattle and
sheep, but had killed the children at play, and
mangled shepherds who were watching with their
flocks. When the people heard that Hercules
was setting out to fight the lion, they tried to persuade
him to give up the adventure; but he, who
had strangled two huge serpents in his infancy, was
not afraid of a lion, however fierce and strong it
might be. So he boldly entered the forest, and having
tracked the great brute to its den, he attacked it
fearlessly and killed it with his bare hands. Then,
throwing the body of the lion over his shoulder, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
started back to the palace of Eurystheus; but when
the king saw Hercules approaching, he begged him
to leave his burden outside the city gates. So the
hero skinned the lion, and took the shaggy pelt to
be henceforth his favorite covering.</p>

<p>Hercules's second labor was to kill the Hydra, a
nine-headed monster that infested the marshes of
Lerna. With the blows of his great oak club the
hero was able to strike off eight of the heads, but
the central one was immortal and could not be
destroyed. Further to complicate the difficulty,
Hercules found that as soon as he struck off one
head, two others sprang up in its place. To prevent
this discouraging miracle from continuing, the
hero bade his friend Iolaus, who had accompanied
him, take a lighted brand and sear the wounds as
soon as they were made. Through this wise precaution
the Hydra was finally killed, and its one
immortal head was buried under a huge rock.
While this difficult struggle was going on, Juno,
always eager to thwart the hero, sent a large crab to
pinch Hercules's feet as he wrestled with the Hydra.
He succeeded in crushing it with his club; but
Juno did not leave its body on the trampled and
blood-stained ground. In recognition of its services
to her, she placed it in the sky as the constellation
of Cancer (the Crab). Before Hercules left the
dead Hydra he dipped some arrows in its venomous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
blood, knowing that any wound received from their
poisoned tips would surely be fatal. These arrows
were later of great service to Hercules, and only
once did he regret their deadly quality.</p>

<p>The next task that Eurystheus set was the
capture of the golden-horned and brazen-hoofed
stag of Cerynea, which ran so swiftly that it did not
seem to touch the ground. Hercules pursued the
stag for many miles, but was unable to overtake it
until he drove it into the cold regions of the north,
where its fleetness was hindered by the great drifts
and the ice-covered ground. Finally the stag ran
into a deep snow bank, and so Hercules captured it
and took it home in triumph.</p>

<p>The fourth labor to which Hercules lent his great
strength was the killing of a wild boar that haunted
Mount Erymanthus in Arcadia. While on this expedition,
the hero was attacked by the centaurs,
and when he shot at them with his poisoned arrows,
one of the deadly missiles flew far and struck his
loved tutor Chiron, who was galloping toward the
combatants, hoping to settle the quarrel peaceably.
When Hercules saw Chiron fall, he rushed to his
side and tried to stanch the fatal wound; but the
dying centaur knew that his end had come, and
sorrowfully bade the hero farewell. To reward
Chiron for his long service, the gods transferred him
to the heavens as the constellation Sagittarius.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
Hercules was next sent to kill the flock of fierce
birds whose cruel beaks and sharp talons made havoc
in the country around Lake Stymphalus. The foul
mist that rose from the stagnant water over which
the birds hovered was so deadly to breathe that
Hercules could hardly approach the lake; but with
the help of his poisoned arrows he was able to wound
the birds at a distance. After hours spent in this
pestilent atmosphere he killed the entire flock and
returned to the court of Eurystheus to report his
success.</p>

<p>The most unpleasant of all Hercules's labors was
the cleaning of the stables where Augeas, king of
Elis, kept his herd of a thousand oxen. These
stables had not been cleaned for thirty years; and
when Hercules caught one glimpse of the filth within
them, he felt that this was too degrading a task for
him to undertake. But the work had to be done;
and since he could not put his hand to anything so
foul, he looked about for some other means to accomplish
the labor. Not far from the stables flowed
two rivers, the Peneus and Alpheus, and these Hercules
turned out of their courses and made them
rush through the filthy building until every part of
the stables of Augeas was washed perfectly clean.
Then he restored the rivers to their former beds, and
returned home to report this task fulfilled.</p>

<p>The next labor that was assigned to the hero was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
the capture of a mad bull given by Neptune to
King Minos. In the early days of his power, Minos
had boasted that he could obtain anything that he
wished from the gods; and had accordingly begged
of Neptune a bull for the sacrifices. The kindly
sea-god sent a splendid offering, but when Minos
saw the bull's size and beauty, he resolved to keep
it. So he substituted another animal for the sacrifices.
This angered Neptune so much that he made
the bull go mad; and it rushed here and there over
the island, causing great terror among the people.
The creature was finally caught and overcome by
Hercules, who rode it through the waves to Greece.
The offspring of this bull was the famous Minotaur
which the hero Theseus pursued through its labyrinth,
and slew.</p>

<p>The eighth labor of Hercules was to bring from
Thrace the horses of Diomedes. These splendid
creatures the king fed on human flesh; and in order
to get a sufficient supply of fresh meat, he decreed
that all strangers who came into his kingdom should
be imprisoned, fattened up, and then served as food
to the horses. To punish Diomedes for his years
of cruelty, Hercules fed him to his own steeds, and
then led them back to Eurystheus, who was proud
to be the possessor of such a prize.</p>

<p>At the court of Eurystheus was the king's beautiful
daughter, Admete, who loved purple and fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
linen, and decked herself with all the jewels that her
father's wealth could command. One day Admete
heard a traveler telling wonderful tales of the girdle
that was worn by Hippolyte, queen of the Amazons;
and at once the spoiled princess demanded of her
father that he send Hercules to procure for her the
coveted girdle. So the hero set out again, accompanied
by his friend Iolaus; and after a hard and
perilous journey came to the country of the Amazons.
These were a fierce, warlike nation of women
who kept in their tribe only the girls who were born
among them and disposed of the boys by killing
them, or by giving them to the neighboring peoples.
The girls were trained in severe military discipline,
and became a race of very redoubtable warriors whom
no king cared to treat with contempt. When Hercules
came before the queen Hippolyte, she received
him kindly, listened to the explanation of his visit,
and even promised to give him the girdle that the
selfish Admete coveted. Before the hero and his
friend set out on their journey homeward, the queen
entertained them royally with feasting and games
that lasted several days. Meantime Juno saw an
opportunity for indulging her hatred of Hercules;
and taking the form of an Amazon, she mingled
freely with the women. By pretending to have
received a heaven-sent message, she persuaded them
that the stranger had used the girdle as a mere pretext<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
for his visit, and that his real intention was
to carry off the queen. The Amazons believed
this artfully-contrived report, and rushed in a body
to protect Hippolyte. They attacked Hercules
fiercely, but he beat them off and finally escaped
with his friend, but not before he had killed several
of the Amazons, including the queen who had befriended
<span class="locked">him.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></span> With the dearly-bought girdle he
returned homeward, and on the way he heard the
proclamation of Laomedon that whoever would save
his daughter Hesione from the sea-monster should
receive a large reward. Hercules killed the beast
and freed the maiden, but was obliged to leave Troy
without the promised gold, because of Laomedon's
perfidy and <span class="locked">greed.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></span></p>

<p>When the ancients looked each evening at the
glowing west, they pictured it as a far-distant country,
more wonderful than any ever seen by mortal
eyes. Here in this land of heart's desire lay
the Garden of the Hesperides, where a dragon
guarded the golden apples that grew on a wonderful
tree which had sprung up miraculously to grace
the wedding of Jupiter and Juno. In this far-off
sunset land were also the Isles of the <span class="locked">Blest,<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
where mortals who had led virtuous lives were
transported without ever tasting of death. Here the
blessed of the gods enjoyed an eternity of bliss; and
wandered happily over the Isles, which had a sun
and moon and stars of their own, and never felt the
touch of wintry winds. In this mysterious region
of the west was the island of Erythea, called "the
red" because it glowed in the light of the setting
sun. To this spot Hercules was sent to take possession
of the oxen of Geryon&mdash;a monster with
three bodies. On his journey to the island, Hercules's
way was blocked by a huge mountain; and
with one blow of his strong oak club he cleft the
opposing rock, and allowed the waters of the sea to
flow through. This is now the strait of Gibraltar,
and the cliffs on either side are called the Pillars of
Hercules.</p>

<p>When the hero reached the island of Erythea, he
found the oxen guarded by the giant Eurytion and
his three-headed dog; but even this did not daunt
the slayer of the Hydra. He boldly attacked the
giant; and after a fierce battle, in which his oak club
stood him in good stead, killed both Eurytion and
the monstrous dog. Then he went in search of the
oxen, and, after herding them closely, drove them
toward his own country. On the journey homeward
he passed Mount Aventine, where the giant
Cacus lived in a rocky cave. One night, as Hercules<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
was asleep near the mountain, the giant stole part
of the cattle; and, to deceive the hero, he dragged
them backwards by their tails into his cave. Hercules
might have been tricked by this stratagem if
the stolen oxen had not lowed loudly as the rest of
the herd passed the cave, and so betrayed their hiding
place. Hercules rushed into the giant's dark,
ill-smelling dwelling, slew him, and recovered all the
stolen cattle.</p>

<span class="subhead">Hercules</span></h2>

<h3>Part II</h3>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">One</span> of the most difficult of Hercules's labors
was to procure the golden apples that the
Hesperides, daughters of Hesperus, god of
the west, guarded very jealously. At the foot of
the tree coiled a fierce dragon whose nostrils poured
out fire, and whose deadly breath would have slain
any venturesome robber, even if he had escaped the
dragon's claws. As Hercules did not know in what
part of the great glowing west the Garden of the
Hesperides lay, he wandered many miles before he
met with any one who could direct him where to go.
The first help he received was from the nymphs of
the Eridanus River, who were sporting on the river
bank and called to Hercules to come and join in
their games. Much as he would have liked to rest,
the hero dared not tarry; but he begged the friendly
nymphs to tell him the way to the Garden of the
Hesperides. They could not help him, but they
advised him to go to old Proteus, "the Ancient of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
the Deep," who could tell him whatever he wished
to know better than any one else. So Hercules went
down to the seashore, and found the hoary god asleep
in his cool green cave. Knowing the old man's wiles,
the hero grasped him firmly and held him fast through
all the bewildering changes by which he sought to
frighten away the stranger. At last, finding himself
securely caught, the Wizard assumed his own form,
and asked Hercules what it was that he wished to
know. The hero stated his errand, and Proteus told
him, "in words that ne'er deceive," that he must
find the giant Atlas who alone knew where the Garden
of the Hesperides lay.</p>

<p>Hercules then started again on his search, and in
the course of his journey came to the Caucasus
Mountains, where he found Prometheus, the stealer
of the sacred fire, bound with adamantine chains to
the rock, while a vulture daily feasted on his <span class="locked">liver.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></span>
Hercules killed the foul bird, broke the chains, and
set Prometheus free; and in return for his deliverance
the grateful Titan directed his rescuer where to
find the giant Atlas. Following Prometheus's advice,
Hercules traveled straightway to Africa; and
on the way he passed through the land of the Pygmies,
a tiny race of warriors who waged continual
warfare with neighboring tribes, and especially with
their deadly enemies, the cranes. Hercules was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
aware that he had reached the country of the <span class="locked">Pygmies;<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></span>
but one day, when he had fallen asleep from
weariness, he was wakened by sharp prickings over
his body; and looking around he saw a host of diminutive
men, attacking him with their tiny weapons.
The hero laughed at these brave efforts, caught up
a few of the doughty little warriors, and, wrapping
them in his lion skin, carried them back with him to
the court of Eurystheus.</p>

<p>As he journeyed through Africa in search of Atlas,
Hercules came to the country of Anteus&mdash;a mighty
giant and wrestler, and the son of Terra, the Earth.
All strangers who came into the land were obliged
to wrestle with him, and if they were defeated, they
were immediately killed. As no one had ever overcome
Anteus, he had brought an untimely death on
many a brave hero; so Hercules was eager to defeat
him and avenge the unknown dead. As soon as
they had grappled for the first struggle, the slayer
of the Hydra knew that he had met more than his
equal in strength. For a long time they wrestled,
Anteus growing stronger after each fall, and Hercules
growing fainter from every additional blow of the
giant's hand. Again and again the undaunted hero
threw his adversary to the ground, but Anteus rose
with redoubled vigor and continued the unequal
contest. Then, all at once, Hercules remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
the tale he had once heard told of a giant who drew
strength from his mother Earth; and believing that
this was the case with Anteus, he made a mighty
effort and lifted the giant from the ground. Anteus
struggled to get his feet again on the earth; but
Hercules kept him in the air, and held him there
until he felt the powerful body beginning to weaken.
Little by little the miraculous strength oozed away,
and soon Anteus grew so weak that Hercules easily
crushed the limp form with his hands.</p>

<p>The hero then traveled on in search of Atlas,
whom he finally found standing on the coast of
Africa, with the great weight of the heavens resting
on his broad shoulders. As Hercules looked up at
the enormous figure, which reached so far into the
clouds that nothing could be seen above his waist,
he noticed that the forests had grown up so thick
and tall all around that only a glimpse of the giant's
huge legs could be seen through the heavy foliage.
As the hero stood watching this figure that for
centuries had stood here in obedience to the divine
command of Jupiter, he saw dark clouds beginning
to gather about the giant's head, and soon a storm
broke over the sea and land. Amid the beating of
the rain and the crash of the thunder, Hercules
thought he heard the voice of Atlas speaking to
him; but it might have been only a peal of thunder.
When the storm was over and the mists rolled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
away from the earth, Hercules saw the head of Atlas
through rifts in the scurrying clouds. The snow-white
hair gave the giant's face a benign look as it
fell thick and white over the stooping shoulders
that bore so terrible a weight. In a voice that he
strove hard to make gentle, Atlas asked the hero
what he was seeking, and Hercules told him that he
had come to get some of the golden apples from the
Garden of the <span class="locked">Hesperides.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></span> Atlas laughed at these
words, and his great shoulders shook so with merriment
that a few of the stars fell out of their places.
Then he told Hercules that such a feat was impossible
even to so great a hero; but that if some one
would take the heavens from his shoulders for a few
hours, he himself would get the <span class="locked">apples.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></span></p>

<p>Hercules was delighted with this offer of assistance,
and agreed to take the giant's burden while
the latter went on his friendly errand. Very carefully
Atlas transferred the heavens to the shoulders
of Hercules, and then sped westward to the Garden
of the Hesperides. The hero was a bit troubled
when he saw Atlas shake his huge shoulders and
stretch himself in delight at his freedom, for it would
be strange, indeed, if the giant were ready to resume
his burden after having tasted the joy of liberty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
With some anxiety Hercules watched him step into
the sea that came only to his knees though he had
waded out a mile from the shore. As Atlas went
deeper and deeper into the waves, at first his huge
bulk loomed like a cliff against the horizon; but
soon it dwindled into a mere speck, and was presently
lost to view. How long he stood holding the
heavens Hercules never knew; but he found himself
growing very weary of his burden, and anxious
over Atlas's long absence. Suddenly he saw a dark
spot on the horizon, and he knew that it was the
giant returning.</p>

<p>It had not been a difficult task for Atlas to reach
the Garden, or to pluck the golden apples from the
carefully-guarded tree; and Hercules, delighted with
the giant's success, thanked him for his trouble and
asked him politely to take the sky again on his
shoulders, for the journey back to the court of
Eurystheus was a long one. Now Atlas had no
desire to stand for another dozen centuries with his
old burden; and seeing a good opportunity of
getting rid of it forever, he told Hercules that he
would carry the apples to Eurystheus himself; and
meanwhile the hero could keep the heavens supported
until Atlas returned. Pretending that he
was quite satisfied with this arrangement, Hercules
bade the giant good-by; then hastily asked him to
wait a moment while he made a pad for his shoulders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
to ease the weight of the unaccustomed burden.
The unsuspicious giant good-naturedly agreed to
this, and took the heavens from Hercules; but instead
of making a cushion, the hero picked up the
golden apples, which Atlas had dropped on resuming
his burden, and started back to his own country,
leaving the giant to stand on the seashore forever,
or until the pitying gods should release him.</p>

<p>The twelfth and last labor of Hercules was to
bring from Hades the three-headed dog, Cerberus.
With the help of Mercury and Minerva, he descended
into the dread realm of Pluto, and begged
that grim monarch to let him take Cerberus into the
upper world. Pluto was not willing at first to lose
the guardian of his gates even for a short time; but
at length he consented to let Hercules do as he
desired on condition that Cerberus should not be
bound or any weapons used upon him. So the
fierce three-headed creature was carried, snarling and
struggling, in the hero's strong arms; and when the
pair approached the throne of Eurystheus, the horror-struck
monarch implored Hercules to take the
monster back as quickly as possible, for the sight of
its dripping jaws, from which oozed the deadly
nightshade, so terrified Eurystheus that he sought
refuge in a huge jar, and would not come out until
his courtiers assured him that Cerberus was safely
out of the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
When the twelve labors were ended, Hercules's
term of service at the court of Eurystheus was over,
and he was free to wander where he willed. He
spent many years roaming through various lands
and assisting other heroes who, like himself, were in
search of adventures. He took part in the battle
between the Centaurs and Lapithæ;<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> joined in the
Argonautic expedition; organized the first siege of
Troy, and braved the terrors of Hades to bring
Alcestis back to her repentant <span class="locked">husband.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></span> The
expedition against Troy was one of revenge, for the
false Laomedon had never paid the gold that he had
promised for the release of his daughter Hesione
from the sea-monster; and Hercules now set out to
punish the treacherous <span class="locked">king.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></span> So he sailed for Troy
with eighteen ships, and the city fell into his hands
with but little resistance. Laomedon was killed,
his son Priam placed on the throne of Troy, and
Hesione given in marriage to Telamon, one of the
Greeks who accompanied Hercules.</p>

<div id="ip_230" class="figcenter" style="width: 441px;"><img src="images/i230.jpg" width="441" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">Hercules serving Omphale</div></div>

<p>The hero's splendid career received a check, however,
for in a quarrel he killed his friend Iphitus, and
the gods, angry at this unnecessary bloodshed, compelled
him to go once more into bondage. So for
three years Hercules served Omphale, queen of
Lydia; and during this time he lived very effeminately,
wearing sometimes the dress of a woman and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
spinning wool with the handmaidens of Omphale,
while the queen wore his lion's skin and wielded his
renowned club. When his years of servitude were
over, he set out again on his wanderings; and during
one of his journeys he met the beautiful Deïaneira,
daughter of Œneus of Calydon and sister of Meleager,
famous in the Calydonian hunt. Hercules
immediately sought the maiden's hand in marriage;
but she had another suitor, the river god Achelous,
who had already obtained her father's consent.
Deïaneira, however, much preferred her new lover,
and begged him to free her from the betrothal with
Achelous. So Hercules challenged the river-god to
a wrestling match, the conditions of the contest being
that he who won should have the maiden in marriage.
Achelous readily agreed to this way of settling
their rival pretensions, for he had no doubt as
to the result of the wrestling.</p>

<p>The opponents were well matched as to strength,
but the river-god had one great advantage, for he
could assume any form he pleased, and thus bewilder
any one who tried to grapple with him. Among his
many changes, he took the form of a serpent; but
when Hercules grasped it by the neck and was about
to strangle it, Achelous became a bull and rushed at
the hero with lowered horns. Skillfully eluding this
unexpected attack, Hercules seized the bull by one
horn and held on so firmly that when the creature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
tried to wrench himself free the horn broke. This
decided the victory in favor of Hercules, and Achelous
departed sullenly to his bed in the river. The
broken horn was appropriated by Fortuna, the goddess
of plenty, who filled it with her treasures, and
adopted it thenceforth as her symbol, calling it
Cornucopia.</p>

<div id="ip_232" class="figcenter" style="width: 446px;"><img src="images/i232.jpg" width="446" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">Fortuna</div></div>

<p>There was nothing now to hinder the marriage of
Hercules with Deïaneira, and the wedding took
place with much mirth and feasting. After several
days of festivity Hercules departed with his wife;
and in the course of their journey homeward, they
came to the river Evenus, which had grown so
swollen and turbid from the heavy rains that it
was impossible to ford it. As the travelers stood
helpless on the bank, the centaur Nessus came
galloping up to them, and offered to carry Deïaneira
across the river in safety. Grateful for this timely
assistance, Hercules placed his wife on the back of
the centaur, who swam with her through the swift-flowing
stream. When they reached the opposite
bank, Deïaneira expected the centaur to stop, that
she might dismount; but Nessus set off at a brisk
trot, hoping to kidnap his fair rider before her
husband could overtake them. Hercules heard
the cries of his terrified bride, and as soon as he
swam the river he sent a swift arrow after the
treacherous Nessus. The poisoned tip sank deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
into the centaur's side, and he knew at once that
he had received his death-wound. With a pretense
at repentance, he asked Deïaneira to forgive his
rash deed; and then, as if granting her a favor, he
told her to take his robe which was stained with
blood, and keep it carefully, for it had wonderful
properties. He assured her that if the time ever
came that Hercules's love grew cold, she had only
to persuade him to put on this magic robe, and his
devotion to her would become more ardent than ever
before. Deïaneira took the robe, but said nothing to
her husband of the centaur's gift, hoping that she
would never have to make use of it.</p>

<p>For many years Hercules and his wife lived
happily together; for, although the hero went on
other adventures, he was always eager to return to
Deïaneira, and she had no need to be reminded of
the centaur's gift. On one of his expeditions, however,
he brought back with him a fair maiden named
Iole, of whom his wife soon grew to be extremely
jealous. Not long after the arrival of Iole, Hercules
wished to offer sacrifices to the gods in honor of his
safe return; so he sent to Deïaneira for a suitable
robe. His wife, trembling for the success of her
venture, bade the messenger Lichas carry to Hercules
the magic robe of Nessus, which she had carefully
guarded all these years. The hero, not knowing
the history of the fatal garment, threw it over his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
shoulders, and as soon as it touched his flesh, the
poisoned blood began its deadly work. The body
of Hercules burned suddenly as if on fire, and
agonizing pains convulsed his frame. He tried to
unloose the fatal robe, but it clung to his skin, and
he tore off part of his flesh in trying to set himself
free. In his rage and pain he turned upon Lichas,
the unhappy bearer of the poisoned robe, and seizing
him in his still powerful arms flung him into the
sea from the top of Mount Œta, where they had assembled
for the sacrifices. Then the hero tore up
huge oak trees by their roots and built a lofty funeral
pyre on which he stretched his pain-wracked limbs.
Calmly he bade his servants apply the torch, but no
one was willing to do this, even to ease his sufferings;
so Hercules turned to his friend Philoctetes,
and after giving him the poisoned arrows, begged
him in pity to light the funeral pyre. The youth
placed beside Hercules the hero's famous oak club,
and covered his body with the lion's skin. Then
he applied a torch to the wood, and the flames rose
with a roar and cracking to the skies. But only the
mortal part of the hero perished, for Jupiter would
not allow the divinity that he had bestowed upon
Hercules to suffer extinction. Purged of his mortality,
the hero took his place in high Olympus,
and even revengeful Juno was so reconciled to his
presence, that she gave him her daughter Hebe in
marriage.</p>

<span class="subhead">Perseus</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">When</span> the wicked King Danaüs persuaded
his daughters to kill their husbands on
their wedding night, there was one, Hypermnestra,
who refused to slay her lover, and by
saving him brought upon the head of cruel Danaüs
the doom that he had striven to <span class="locked">escape.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></span> The grandson
of Hypermnestra and Lynceus was Acrisius, king
of Argo, a kindly ruler who dearly loved his only
daughter Danaë, and kept her always near him to
delight his eyes with her great beauty. Unfortunately
the king chanced to learn from an oracle
that he would one day be killed by his grandson;
and hoping to prevent this, he shut Danaë in a high
brazen tower which no one was allowed to enter on
pain of death. He placed around the tower a strong
guard, so that no one could get even a glimpse of
the imprisoned princess; but though no mortal
wooer could approach her, Danaë's loveliness was
not hidden from Jupiter's eyes, and as he looked
down from high Olympus he pitied the maiden's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
loneliness and loved her for her great beauty. Fearing
to frighten her if he assumed any mortal disguise,
and not daring to appear before her in his
divine splendor, he took the form of a golden
shower, which fell softly on the sill of the tower
window and charmed the lonely captive with its
brightness. Each day this strange visitor came to
glorify her darkened room, and Danaë looked forward
eagerly to its appearance. Thus by means of
the golden shower Jupiter won the maiden's confidence
and love, and spent many hours with her in
the high tower room. Danaë was not lonely any
more, but people who passed beneath her window
could hear her singing to herself all day long.</p>

<p>One morning the astonished attendants rushed to
King Acrisius and told him that in the brazen tower
was a mother and child&mdash;his daughter Danaë had
given birth to a son who was so beautiful that they
called him Perseus. The king was enraged at this
news, and threatened to put the boy to death; but
as he was unwilling to stain his hands with the blood
of his grandson&mdash;even though this grandson might
cause his own death&mdash;he put Danaë and her infant
in a cask, and set them adrift on the sea. For days
the strange boat tossed about on the ever-rocking
waves, and the poor frightened mother prayed to
the gods to save her and her hapless child. Jupiter
heard her cries, and no storms came to beat the frail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
boat upon the rocks, nor did any rough seas imperil
the voyager's safety. At last the cask was
washed gently up on the shores of the island of
Seriphus, where a friendly fisherman rescued Danaë
and her child and took them to the king, Polydectes.
This ruler received them kindly, and
allowed them to live at his court; and here the
young Perseus grew up into manhood, learning all
the games and sports that belonged to the training
of a Grecian youth.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Polydectes had become so enamored
of Danaë that he wished to marry her, and grew
very angry at her continued refusals. His wrath
was increased when Perseus forbade him to distress
Danaë any longer with his unwelcome attentions.
As Polydectes did not dare to kill Perseus or banish
him from the kingdom&mdash;for he knew that his suit
would then be hopeless&mdash;he began to taunt the
youth with his inexperience, and asked him why he
did not set out on some adventure to prove his
mettle like other heroes. Perseus did not consider
himself a hero, but he hoped some day to do great
things; and the sneers of the king worked on his
proud heart, as that wily old monarch had expected.
The youth then demanded to have his courage and
endurance put to the test, and Polydectes promptly
told him to go and slay the Gorgon Medusa, and
bring her head back as the proof of his valor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
Perseus needed no urging to set out at once, though
he well knew the danger of the undertaking. His
mother implored him to remain with her, but the
youth was determined not to endure Polydectes's
taunts any longer, and he was eager to prove his
bravery, even at the risk of his life.</p>

<p>There were three of the Gorgons, all of them
hideous to behold; but Medusa was by far the most
<span class="locked">terrible,<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></span> for besides her frightful appearance she
had the power to turn those who looked at her into
stone. She was once a beautiful maiden, who had
had the misfortune to offend Minerva, and that goddess,
to punish her, changed her into a dragonlike
creature with long tusks, a scaly hide, brazen claws,
and instead of hair a writhing mass of snakes. To
this monster Polydectes sent the young Perseus,
feeling sure that he would never return home alive.</p>

<p>The young hero had not journeyed far before he
noticed that some one was walking beside him, and,
turning to look more closely at the stranger, he
was at once surprised and frightened at recognizing
Mercury. But the messenger of the gods bade him
have no fear, for he himself had come to help in the
perilous quest for the Gorgon's head. Then Mercury
lent Perseus his own winged sandals, and told
the youth that he would have to do some swift
moving in the course of his adventures. The god<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
also lent him a magic helmet that rendered the
wearer invisible, and bade him offer thanks to Pluto
as the sender of this invaluable gift. Not to be
outdone by the other gods in kindness, the august
Minerva lent Perseus her shield&mdash;the terrible Ægis
of Jupiter&mdash;which the warrior-goddess carried with
her to battle. Thus equipped for the combat Perseus
had no fear of encountering the dread Medusa
of the snaky locks, and pressed forward eagerly on
his journey. He had already inquired of Mercury
the way to the Gorgon's cave, but the god could
not direct him, and told him that he must find the
Grææ and learn the way from them.</p>

<p>The Grææ were three hideous old women who
had been gray-haired from birth,&mdash;and so received
their name,&mdash;and they lived in a far-off land, where
eternal darkness reigned. They had only one tooth
and one huge eye among them, and passed these
around to each other in turn. As they alone could
tell him where Medusa dwelt, Perseus started northward
on Mercury's winged sandals, and after flying
for many days in search of the Three Sisters, he
came at last to their cheerless land. He found the
Gray Old Women seated under a drooping willow-tree
that fell so far over them that it almost hid
their shrunken forms.</p>

<p>As Perseus approached the spot where the Gray
Old Women sat crooning to themselves, he took
good care to keep on his magic helmet, and he
watched closely to see when the eye was being transferred
from one old head to the other. Just as the
eldest sister was taking out the great eye, and the
one who was next in turn was holding out her
shriveled hand to receive it, Perseus stepped quickly
between them and snatched it away. The old
woman began to grope for it in her pitiable blindness,
and then arose a fierce dispute among the
sisters as to who really had the eye. To end the
quarreling Perseus spoke gently to them, telling them
that he had taken their treasured eye, and would
return it to them as soon as they had informed him
where to find Medusa of the snaky locks. For a
while the Gray Old Women pretended that they had
never heard of Medusa, but finding that the unseen
speaker was determined to keep their precious eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
until he had received the desired information, they
told him the way to the Gorgon's Cave. Perseus
then returned to them the huge eye, which seemed
to stare at him with a very knowing look, and sped
off on his winged sandals to the country where
Medusa dwelt.</p>

<p>As he flew along the seacoast he saw in the distance
a dark cavern among the rocks, and in front
of it, on the glaring white sand, lay a monster which,
even from his great height above the water, Perseus
could not glance at without shuddering. Remembering
Minerva's caution when she gave him her
shield, he used its bright surface as a mirror in
which were reflected all the objects below; and
never once was he tempted to turn his eyes toward
the dreadful figure on the beach. Its scaly hide
glistened in the sunlight, its brazen claws shone like
live coals, and the snakes that lay coiled around its
head shot out their tongues and hissed whenever
the Gorgon stirred in its sleep. As Perseus drew
nearer he saw, reflected in his polished shield, the
forms of men and animals that had been turned to
stone by one glance at Medusa's face. These were
very numerous around the mouth of the cave, and
Perseus silently prayed to the gods that his figure
might not be added to the number. Some distance
away lay the other two Gorgons, Medusa's sisters,
but the young hero had no thought for them. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
whole attention was centered on the blow that he
must deal the sleeping Medusa before the snakes
hissed so loudly that she would awaken. Even in
his shield the sight of that twisting, wriggling mass
of reptiles was so repulsive that Perseus shuddered
and was tempted to turn away; but just then he
heard a whisper. "Be quick. Strike swift and
sure;" and as he recognized the voice of Mercury,
all his courage returned.</p>

<p>Grasping his sword more firmly and holding his
bright shield above the sleeping monster, he swooped
suddenly down upon it, and with one swift stroke cut
off the great head with all its coils of serpents. It
was only a moment's work to sheathe his sword and
grasp the hideous trophy in his hands; but even then
the danger was not over, for the snakes on Medusa's
head began to hiss so loudly that their noise awoke
the other two sleeping Gorgons, and they looked
around to find why their sister had disturbed their
rest. Seeing Medusa's headless body on the sand,
they set up such terrible cries that the noise re-echoed
like thunder through the cavern, and as far
away as Perseus had already flown, he could hear
the awful sounds that made the seashore seem like
some vision in a dreadful nightmare.</p>

<div id="ip_242" class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><img src="images/i242.jpg" width="450" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">Perseus</div></div>

<p>As he hurried over the sea with Medusa's head
held firmly in his hand, some of the blood dripped
down into the white-capped waves and was cherished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
by Neptune, who had once loved Medusa
when she was a beautiful maiden. From these
drops of blood the sea-king created the wonderful
winged horse, Pegasus, who was to share in the adventures
of another famous hero, Bellerophon.
Some of the Gorgon's blood had also dropped on
the hot African sand, as Perseus was flying upward
from the Gorgon's cave, and from this sprang a
brood of poisonous reptiles that ever afterward infested
that region and brought death to many an
unwary explorer.</p>

<p>The journey homeward was long and wearisome,
and Perseus was often obliged to seek the seashore
to rest. Once as he was flying along the coast of
Africa, borne aloft on the winged sandals, he saw
old Atlas standing where he had stood for many
centuries with the weight of the heavens on his
bent shoulders. The clouds wrapped his head
so completely that Perseus could see only his immense
body. Forests had grown up so high all
around him that his huge legs were scarcely visible
among the heavy foliage, and his broad shoulders
looked like mighty bowlders rising up above
the tree-tops. But though his head <i>was</i> so far
in the clouds, Atlas knew that Perseus was approaching,&mdash;for
giants have certain senses unpossessed
by mortal men,&mdash;and he shook the clouds
from about his face, and blew away the mists with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
his breath. Then, when the air was clear, and
Perseus could see the white hair that was previously
hidden above the clouds, he pitied poor Atlas for
his heavy punishment and stopped to speak with
him. The giant looked down from his great
height and begged the hero to uncover Medusa's
head,&mdash;which Perseus had kept wrapped in his
cloak,&mdash;for he was anxious to gaze upon it and
become himself an image of stone. He told how
weary he was of standing for all these ages without
ever being able to rest, and he could not endure the
thought of keeping up this torture for eternity.
So Perseus lifted up the Gorgon's head, being careful
to keep his own averted, and Atlas gazed long
and eagerly at the dead face, with its wreath of lifeless
serpents. Then slowly the giant's great bulk
began to harden, and the stooping shoulders became
firm, unfeeling stone. As Perseus stood
there watching the strange transformation, he seemed
to see no longer the floating white hair of Atlas,
but a pile of snow on a mountain top; and he
looked no more on the huge limbs surrounded by
forests, but he saw rents and clefts on a mountain
side that just showed themselves through the thick
trees. Thus was the burden of Atlas forever removed
from his aching shoulders, and the heavens
now rested securely on a mountain.</p>

<p>When Perseus resumed his journey along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
coast, he soon came to a place where the cliffs rose
abruptly from the sea; and as he looked down at
the rocks below him, he saw, outlined against
their dark surface, a figure that made him pause in
his swift flight, and wonder if a sudden madness
had taken hold on his fancy; for chained to the
rock was a maiden so beautiful that even her constant
weeping had not marred the perfect loveliness
of her face. Keeping the Gorgon's head carefully
concealed under his cloak, so that the captive
maiden could get no glimpse of the snaky locks,
Perseus flew to the girl's side, and, taking off his
magic helmet, spoke to her gently. At any other
time she would have been startled at this sudden
appearance of a stranger; but the thought of her
dreadful fate, so near at hand, drove all other fears
from her mind. The spray from the sea dashed
over her, and the cold winds blew on her shivering
form; but of this she seemed to be hardly aware.
Her eyes were fixed in wild terror upon a cavern
in the rocks, where Perseus could see a huge dragon
lying stretched out on the cool, slimy seaweed.</p>

<p>When the young hero spoke to the maiden,
she did not seem to hear him, but, at his gentle
persistence, she at last turned her eyes away
from the dreaded cavern and told him her story.
She said that her name was Andromeda, and that
her mother, <span class="locked">Cassiopeia,<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></span> had angered the sea-nymphs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
by presuming to rival them in beauty. To punish
the queen for her vanity, the nymphs sent a fierce
sea-monster to devastate the homes along the coast;
and when the terrified people consulted an oracle to
know how they might save themselves from further
disaster, they were told that the monster would not
depart until the Princess Andromeda was sacrificed
to its fury. So the king, her father, and her wretched,
remorseful mother, and a procession of weeping attendants
had led her, that very day, to the rocks,
and had chained her fast to await the monster's
pleasure.</p>

<p>Just as Andromeda was speaking, there was a
rustling sound in the cave, as if the dragon were
stretching its huge wings. Then came a sudden
whir and rush, as the monster glided out of the dim
interior of its cave, and came speeding through the
water toward its victim. The scaly hide glittered
in the sunlight, and the great coils of its snaky body
beat up the waves as it came with incredible swiftness
toward the captive maiden, whose terrified
shrieks almost unnerved the young hero who had
come to rescue her. Quickly he donned his magic
helmet and grasped the keen-edged sword that had
already stood him in good stead. As the monster's
head emerged from the waves, Perseus rushed upon
it unseen, and with a quick thrust pierced the creature
in its one vital spot. The dragon sank back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
into the blood-stained water, and then made a few
ineffective plunges toward its victim; but Perseus's
blow had been sure, and the creature's great body
finally disappeared beneath the waves. While Andromeda
was thanking her deliverer with grateful
tears, he struck off the chains that bound her to the
rock, and led her to where her parents and an astonished
group of watchers had been looking on at the
strange combat. The great joy of Andromeda's
father was equaled only by the mother's happiness
over her rescued child; and they both welcomed
the young hero who had saved her from so terrible
a <span class="locked">fate.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></span></p>

<p>When Perseus had been entertained royally for
several days, the king bade him demand any reward
that he wished for his heroic services; and the
youth boldly asked Andromeda's hand in marriage.
To this the parents gladly consented, although she
was already betrothed to her uncle Phineus, and the
preparations were begun at once for the wedding.
While the marriage celebrations were in progress,
the jilted suitor, who had been too timid to attempt
any rescue of Andromeda, now came forward to
claim his wife. His pretensions were laughed at,
however, and he left the court angry and plotting
revenge. The following day he appeared with a
band of followers and suddenly attacked Perseus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
who had barely time to defend himself. The
friends of the young hero rallied to his support, but
they were outnumbered by the attacking party, and a
disastrous battle might have ensued, had not Perseus
bethought himself of a sure means of defense.
Catching up the cloak in which he had wrapped the
Gorgon's head, he cried: "Whoever is my friend,
let him turn away his eyes." The courtiers of King
Cepheus, and the men fighting around Perseus
obeyed him; but Phineus and his followers believed
this to be a mere trick to gain time, and looked on
while Perseus unveiled Medusa's snaky head. Some
of the gazers had their spears in uplifted hands;
some were fitting arrows to their bows as they
turned their eyes a moment toward Perseus; but in
whatever position they stood, just so they were suddenly
turned into stone. By some chance Phineus
had been watching his men instead of looking at the
Gorgon's head; and when he saw their dreadful
transformation, he fell on his knees before Perseus,
and with outstretched hands implored the hero to
spare his life. But Perseus forced him to look upon
the hideous face of Medusa, and he became a stone
image with averted head and supplicating arms.</p>

<p>Having thus disposed effectively of his enemies,
Perseus covered up his death-dealing trophy, and
the wedding ceremonies were resumed. Later he
departed with his bride to the country of Polydectes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
where that king had been keeping his mother a
prisoner until she would consent to marry him.
He had long ago believed Perseus dead, and was
therefore much astonished to see him appear unharmed
and victorious. Hearing of the cruel treatment
his mother had received from Polydectes, the
young hero determined on a swift revenge. In the
presence of the king and his court, he suddenly displayed
the head of Medusa; and the whole company,
just as they stood, were turned into stone.
Then Perseus set sail with his wife and mother for
his own country; but before he left he returned to
Pluto the magic helmet, to Mercury the winged
sandals, and to Minerva the wonderful Ægis. The
august goddess of wisdom seemed to have taken a
strange fancy to the Gorgon's head, so Perseus gave
her this trophy of his victory, and she fixed it in the
middle of her shield.</p>

<p>When Perseus, with Andromeda and Danaë, arrived
in Argo, they found that old Acrisius had
been driven from his throne, and that a usurper was
enjoying the kingdom. It did not take long for
the hero who had slain Medusa to kill the unlawful
claimant, and reinstate his grandfather. The old
man had been languishing for years in prison, and
was hardly able to endure the great joy of his release
at the hands of one whom he had long since believed
to be dead. Things seemed to be settled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
very happily in spite of the oracle; but the decrees
of the gods are sure to be fulfilled, and one day
when Perseus was playing quoits, he accidentally
threw one wide of the mark. It struck Acrisius,
who was looking on at the game, and killed him
instantly. This unfortunate mishap so preyed upon
Perseus's mind that he could not remain in Argo,
but exchanged his kingdom for that of Mycenæ,
over which he ruled for many years very wisely and
well. When at last Perseus died, the gods placed
him among the stars with his wife Andromeda, and
with Cassiopeia, who had long since been cured of
her vanity.</p>

<span class="subhead">Bellerophon</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">At</span> the court of Prœtus, king of Argos, there
dwelt as guest of honor a young prince
named Bellerophon. He was a kinsman of
Prœtus and a grandson of Sisyphus, king of Corinth,
so much honor was shown him. As he was
strong, brave, and fearless, he was a leader in all the
games; and his beauty won such favor at the court
that Prœtus's wife, Queen Anteia, sought his love.
Since the youth could not in loyalty return her affection,
he found it difficult to remain in Argos; for
the queen was not content to receive only the courtesy
due her, but importuned Bellerophon for his
love. He tried many times to find some pretext for
leaving his kinsman; so when Prœtus proposed
that he should make a journey to Lycia to deliver
some important messages to its ruler, the youth was
eager to go. Meanwhile the queen, angered at his
indifference, had told her husband that Bellerophon
delighted in treating her with contempt in return
for all her kindness, and that she could not endure
his presence in Argos any longer. She demanded
further that Prœtus should put the young man at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
once to death, but that he should not let Bellerophon
suspect that she had been the instigator of the
deed. The king readily believed his wife's artfully
contrived story, and declared that the insolent youth
should be made to pay dearly for his ingratitude.
As Bellerophon was already a hero at the court,
Prœtus dared not condemn him openly to death;
so when the prince departed on his journey to Lycia,
he carried with him some <span class="locked">letters<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></span> whose purport he
was far from suspecting; for the sealed message that
he bore so light-heartedly was a request to King
Iobates to put the bearer at once to death.</p>

<p>King Iobates was the father-in-law of Prœtus;
and the ruler of Lycia had often relied on his powerful
relative as an ally in time of war; so the king
of Argos was confident that his instructions would
be carried out. The expedition to Lycia might,
therefore, have had a different ending had not
Bellerophon forgotten to deliver his letters for
several days. Meanwhile King Iobates, supposing
him to be on a friendly visit, received him very hospitably
and made him a member of the royal household.
After much feasting and entertainment, the
young prince suddenly remembered the sealed message
intrusted to his care, and hastened to deliver it
to Iobates with many apologies for his forgetfulness.
When the king read the letter, he was surprised and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
horrified at its contents, for he could not, in cold
blood, kill the guest who had sat at his table; and
yet he did not wish to refuse any demand made by
Prœtus. When the courtiers saw his white face
and troubled looks, they wondered what the message
contained; but no one suspected its real import.</p>

<p>At last a solution of the difficulty came to the
king's mind, and he began to praise Bellerophon for
the bravery and courage that had made the young
prince famous throughout Greece. He lamented that
no such fearlessness dwelt among the men of Lycia,
for otherwise the Chimæra would not be living in
security and laying waste the king's lands. When
Bellerophon heard what terror was inspired by the
mere mention of the Chimæra's name, he wondered
whether he would be afraid to face this fearful creature
with its lion's head, goat's body, and dragon's
tail. When he expressed surprise that no hero had
slain it, the wily Iobates at once implored him to
help the stricken country and to go himself to fight
the Chimæra. Bellerophon might have been eager
for this adventure, had he not learned to love the
king's daughter Philonoë, who had found the handsome
stranger more to her liking than all the youths
of Lycia. He was, therefore, loath to leave the
princess and depart on so perilous a venture; but at
the repeated urging of Iobates, he began to make
preparations for the journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
Before setting out he first consulted the soothsayer
<span class="locked">Polyidus,<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></span> who advised him to procure the
winged horse <span class="locked">Pegasus<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></span> if he hoped to succeed in
slaying the Chimæra. This advice was probably
well-meant, but it was very discouraging; for how
could Bellerophon expect to bridle the famous immortal
steed that had never known the touch of
any man's hand? He knew too well that Pegasus
was rarely seen by mortal eyes, for he dwelt on the
calm heights of Mount Helicon, a spot sacred to the
Muses, and seldom came to earth except to visit
the fountain of Pirene, near Corinth, whose clear
waters sometimes tempted him to leave his lofty
home. Very few people had ever seen the snow-white
horse, with his wonderful silvery wings that
carried him through the air as buoyantly as an eagle
in its flight. Whenever Pegasus deigned to come
to earth to taste the sweet waters of Pirene he sped
over the grassy meadows so swiftly that even the
fleetest runner could not hope to catch him. He
had never been bridled in all his wild, free life, and
for beauty and strength and sheer joy of living there
was nothing like him in the whole wide world.
"Sleeping at night as he did, on a lofty mountain
top, and passing the greater part of the day in the
air, Pegasus seemed hardly to be a creature of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
earth. Whenever he was seen, up very high above
people's heads, with the sunshine on his silvery
wings, one would have thought that he belonged to
the sky, and that, skimming a little too low, he had
got astray among our mists and vapors, and was
seeking his way back again.... In the summer
time, and in the beautifullest of weather, Pegasus
often alighted on the solid earth, and, closing his
silvery wings, would gallop over hill and dale for
pastime as fleetly as the <span class="locked">wind."<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></span></p>

<p>When Bellerophon was advised to catch this
glorious winged steed, it was no wonder that he felt
discouraged, for nowhere could he find an old man,
a maiden, or a child who had ever had so much as
a glimpse of the snow-white Pegasus. Some one
told him, however, that the immortal steed had
once been tamed by Minerva, and owed obedience
to her; so he went immediately to the temple of the
warrior-goddess, and begged her to help him. For
many hours he prayed before Minerva's shrine, but
there came no answer to his petition; and, at last,
worn out with fatigue and discouragement, he fell
asleep on the steps of the temple. When the first
rays from Apollo's golden sun-car fell on the white
marble pillars of the temple, Bellerophon awoke, and
to his great astonishment he found in his hand a
golden bridle. Believing this to be the answer to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
his prayers, he set out hopefully on his search for
the winged horse; and before journeying very far,
he came to the fountain of Pirene, where the beautiful,
clear stream bubbled up beside a grassy meadow
so redolent of ripening clover that it might tempt
a far more fastidious horse than the immortal
Pegasus. Bellerophon spent many days beside the
fountain, but he never caught a glimpse of the
white-winged steed, nor saw any mark of his hoofs
upon the sod. Once an old man stopped to ask
him why he was lingering so long beside the fountain,
and then shook his white head incredulously
when Bellerophon spoke of Pegasus and his silvery
wings.</p>

<p>At last the young hero grew so discouraged that
he decided to return to the court of Iobates; but
on the very morning that he was intending to leave
Pirene, he chanced to wake just at dawn, and,
leaning over the fountain to bathe his flushed
face he saw reflected in the water an image that
made his heart beat fast with hope and joy.
It seemed like a great white bird, flying high up
among the clouds, where the sunlight shone on
its silvery wings. Nearer and nearer it came,
sweeping the air in great wide circles, and at last
it alighted beside the fountain. Bellerophon meantime
had hidden himself in the bushes, and now he
watched the beautiful creature as it folded its gorgeous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
wings and bent its arching neck to drink the
clear water. Then Pegasus daintily cropped a few
clover blossoms, shook his long white mane, and
began to run up and down over the meadows, capering
madly like a colt just set free in the pasture.
After rolling luxuriously in the thick grass, and
racing like the wind across the meadow, Pegasus
grew tired of his play, and folding his snow-white
wings, trotted quietly up to the fountain to take
one more drink before flying back to his home on
Mount Helicon.</p>

<p>Then Bellerophon crept noiselessly out of his hiding
place, and while the unsuspicious Pegasus was
drinking the cool water and his eyes were no longer
watchful, the youth boldly sprang upon his back
and took firm hold of the thick mane, being careful
meantime not to let Minerva's golden bridle slip
from his fingers. Bellerophon had ridden many a
horse, but never one as wild and spirited as this; for
the glorious Pegasus had not known, until now, the
ignominy of bearing a mortal rider on his back, and
he did not intend to submit to the disgrace. When
he felt the touch of Bellerophon's knees on his broad
flanks, he made a tremendous bound into the air,
and before the youthful rider could realize what had
happened, he found himself hundreds of feet above
the earth. The winged horse snorted, and shook
with anger, and tried to unseat his rider by every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
trick known to equine ingenuity. He bounded forward
with a sudden jerk, reared, turned over and
over in the air, until half the time Bellerophon was
riding with his head downward; but in spite of all
his efforts, he could not throw off the strange thing
that clung to his back. All at once Bellerophon
saw his chance to slip the golden bridle between the
maddened horse's teeth, and suddenly Pegasus became
as gentle and tractable as if he had always
obeyed the will of a master.</p>

<p>Happy to find the conflict over, the young hero
turned the head of his white-winged steed toward
the mountain-region where the dread Chimæra
dwelt. It was a wild and rocky part of the country
that Bellerophon looked down upon, and he saw all
around him the evidence of ruin wrought by the
fire-breathing monster. The dwellings of the peasants
were in smoking ashes; carcasses of half-eaten
cattle were strewn about the barren pastures; and
human bodies were also to be seen, torn and mangled
by the Chimæra's ruthless claws. On the mountain
side was a deep hole in the rocks, and from
it issued clouds of black smoke that had a horrid
stifling smell as it rose up from the cavern's
mouth. As Bellerophon descended nearer to the
earth, the delicate nostrils of his horse dilated at the
first contact with the foul smoke, and he found it
hard to persuade Pegasus to fly closer to the Chimæra's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
den. When they did approach through
the thick clouds of smoke, Bellerophon saw the
monster's great body stretched out at full length in
the cave, while all the three heads lay on half-eaten
carcasses that were strewn about the floor. The
lion and the goat part of the Chimæra were asleep,
but the snake was wide awake; and when it saw
Bellerophon approaching on his winged horse, it
raised its head and began to hiss so loudly that it
roused up the other creatures until they too were
intent and watchful.</p>

<p>Then the smoke poured out of the cave more
thickly than before; and if Pegasus had not
carried him quickly away from the poisonous fumes,
Bellerophon would have been suffocated long
before he was able to get near enough to deal
the Chimæra a mortal blow. But the brave horse
bore him out of danger, and kept him far above
the thick smoke until the monster crawled out of its
lair. Then like the swift rush of air, Bellerophon
swooped down upon the Chimæra and cut off its
three horrid heads with his sword; but even then
the danger was not over, for the headless creature
sprang into the air, and clutched wildly for its enemy
with its long claws. So sure an instinct for destruction
did the Chimæra have that, mangled and dying
as it was, it struck directly at Bellerophon and
would have torn him into pieces had not the faithful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
Pegasus borne him swiftly out of reach of the
deadly claws. After a few vain attempts to grasp
its destroyer, the Chimæra's great body gave a convulsive
shudder, and fell back stone-dead upon the
blood-soaked ground.</p>

<p>Then Bellerophon sped back to the court of Iobates
and announced that the Chimæra was dead.
The king was glad to hear that the monster could
no longer devastate his land, but he was sorry to see
Bellerophon returning unhurt and victorious, and
with such a wonderful prize as the winged horse,
Pegasus. Most people had never believed that
this immortal steed really existed, and had thought
that the stories about it were merely old wives'
tales. Iobates did not dare to kill so popular a hero
as the young prince became after this adventure, but
he sent him off on other perilous journeys, hoping
that on one of them he might meet his death.
Bellerophon, however, never came to any harm, for
he had always the sure help of Pegasus, and he returned
safe from each expedition with trophies to
lay at the feet of his beloved princess, Philonoë.
At length the king was convinced that Bellerophon
was under the special protection of the gods, and,
hoping to win their favor, he gave the young hero
his daughter in marriage, and appointed him his
successor to the throne.</p>

<p>For several years Bellerophon lived happily in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
Lycia; but his many victories with Pegasus had
made him presumptuous, and he felt that his
true place was with the immortals. So one day
he mounted his winged steed and flew far above
the earth into the white clouds that wrap the
top of Mount Olympus. Angered at this insolence
and daring, Jupiter sent an enormous gadfly which
stung Pegasus so cruelly that he gave a sudden leap
forward, and this unexpected movement threw his
too-confident rider from his back. The luckless
Bellerophon felt the reins slip through his fingers,
and he plunged downward through mist and clouds
many, many miles to the earth. This terrible fall
would have killed any one but a mythological hero,
but Bellerophon, though bruised and shaken, only
lost his eyesight. Ever afterwards he wandered
through the fair places of the earth, lame and blind
and lonely, lamenting the foolish pride that had led
him to risk the anger of the gods. What his end
was no one ever knew, but he probably died in
some distant land, alone and forgotten, while Pegasus
went back to the sunny slopes of Mount Helicon
and never visited the earth again, even to drink the
sweet waters of Pirene.</p>

<span class="subhead">The Story of Jason</span></h2>

<h3>Part I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">In</span> Thessaly there once ruled a wise and good
king named Æson, who dwelt happily with his
wife Alcimede, and his little son Jason. The
king's reign did not last long, however, for his wicked
brother Pelias collected a band of armed warriors
and made war upon Æson, who, after a feeble resistance,
surrendered his throne to the invader and
escaped secretly from the kingdom with his wife and
child. The dethroned monarch took refuge in a
distant country, and lived in concealment until
Jason was old enough to be sent to some place of
greater safety, for they knew that the cruel Pelias
would try to seek him out and kill him. So they
intrusted the boy to the care of the centaur Chiron,
after telling that wise teacher who the lad really was,
and begging him to bring Jason up with the desire
some day to avenge their wrongs.</p>

<p>Chiron instructed the youth in all the arts of
which he himself was master, and when the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
prince reached manhood, he was one of the bravest
and most skillful of the centaur's pupils. Jason
had been told many times of his uncle's tyranny,
and he burned to avenge the wrongs of his parents;
but his wise teacher cautioned him to wait until he
had strength and power enough to face the wicked
usurper. When he deemed the youth sufficiently
trained to leave his care, Chiron sent Jason forth,
bidding him satisfy now his desire for revenge. He
advised his pupil, however, to be careful and to do no
harm to any one except the man who had wronged
him. Jason promised to obey his tutor's instructions,
and, girding on his sword, set out on the
journey to his native city.</p>

<p>It was springtime when Jason turned his steps
toward his father's kingdom, and the rains had
swollen all the streams, making them difficult to
ford. One day as he stood on the bank of a river,
wondering where he had best attempt to swim
across, he saw an old woman looking despairingly
at the rushing, foaming water. Jason spoke gently
to her, and offered to carry her across the river.
This unexpected assistance was gratefully accepted,
and Jason bravely waded into the shallowest part of
the stream. The swift current and his unwieldy
burden made the crossing very difficult, so that when
Jason at last reached the opposite bank, he was glad
to rest. He did not mind the wetting, but he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
sorry to find that he had lost one of his sandals in
the river. As it was useless to try to find it, he set
off with only the remaining one, but first he stopped
to say good-by to the old woman. To his surprise
he no longer saw a bent and trembling figure beside
him, but he stood in the presence of a beautiful,
imperious woman, whose royal bearing would have
proclaimed her a goddess even if the startled youth
had not seen beside her the peacock that ever attends
the stately Juno. Jason trembled at this transformation
of his aged passenger, but Juno smiled
graciously upon him and bade him have no fear, for
she had come to promise him her aid and protection.</p>

<p>Before he could render suitable thanks, the goddess
had disappeared, and Jason continued his
journey, full of courage and confident of success.
Soon he came to his native city, where he found a
great crowd of people assembled at the temple, for
Pelias, the king, was offering on that day special
sacrifices, and a public festival had been proclaimed
throughout the city. Jason joined in the crowds
that were hurrying to the temple, and stood quite
near his uncle, while the king, unconscious of his
presence, was performing the sacrifices. When the
ceremony was over, Pelias glanced around at the
assembled company, and started back pale with
terror when he saw Jason; for although he did not
recognize his nephew, he had been warned by an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
oracle to beware of a youth who would appear before
him wearing only one sandal. Trembling, but
striving to hide his fear, Pelias spoke to the stranger
and asked him his name. Then Jason confronted
his uncle boldly, declared his own parentage, and
demanded that the usurper should at once resign
his throne and restore old Æson to his rightful
place in the kingdom.</p>

<p>Pelias did not dare openly to defy this fearless
youth, but neither did he intend to give up his
power and wealth; so being a crafty man he sought
to beguile Jason with soft words, and promised to
send at once for the absent king and queen. He
urged his nephew to remain meanwhile at the court,
and invited him to join the royal household that
evening in a splendid banquet. Jason needed no
persuasion to eat, drink, and be merry; and as the
wily Pelias plied him with rich viands and the choicest
wine, his heart warmed toward his uncle, and he
felt less eager to carry out his long-cherished vengeance.
During the feast the bards sang of brave
deeds done by heroes, and one old musician told
of the famous golden fleece that many had sought
to take by stealth; but of those who went on the
quest, no one ever came back to tell why he had
failed.</p>

<p>Jason listened eagerly while the old singer told
how the famous fleece once belonged to a ram that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
the friendly Neptune sent to Phryxus and Helle to
enable them to escape from the persecutions of their
stepmother Ino. This was the same Ino who cared
so tenderly for the infant Bacchus; but to her stepchildren
she was very cruel. Their own mother
Nephele had been sent away by King Athamas because
he had wearied of her, and wished to marry
Ino; and when the banished mother learned how
neglected and ill-treated her children were, she
begged Neptune to help them. So the sea-god
sent a golden-fleeced ram, which Phryxus and Helle
mounted and thus escaped from their cruel stepmother.
Only Phryxus reached the land of Colchis,
however; for when the ram flew over the sea, Helle
grew frightened at the sight of the waves tossing so
far beneath her, and suddenly lost her hold on the
golden fleece. Her brother reached out to clutch
her as she slid from the ram's back, but it was too
late, and the unfortunate maiden fell into that part
of the sea that is since known as the Hellespont.
Phryxus reached Colchis safely, and here he sacrificed
the ram to Neptune, and hung its golden fleece on
a tree under which he placed a dragon to guard it
night and day.</p>

<p>As Jason listened to this story he felt as though
here was a task worth his mettle; and it needed no
urging from Pelias to make him declare himself
ready to set forth on the adventure without further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
delay. The wily king praised Jason's courage, and
prophesied that he would be called the greatest
among heroes, while in his heart he felt assured that
the troublesome nephew would never return alive.
He promised to render Jason every assistance in his
power, and offered to fit him out with a well-manned
ship; but the young adventurer had been thinking
over the matter more calmly, and had begun to distrust
his uncle's apparent kindness. So he went for
counsel to the shrine of Jupiter at Dodona, where
there was an oracle called the Speaking Oak; and,
on consulting this, he learned, to his great satisfaction,
that Juno was still watching over his welfare,
and would aid him in the quest of the golden fleece.
The Speaking Oak then bade him cut off one of its
great limbs, and carve from it a figurehead for his
ship. It told him also that the ship in which he
was to sail should not be made of timber cut from
any ordinary trees, but should be built of the wood
taken from pine-trees that grew on Mount Pelion.</p>

<p>When Jason had carved his figurehead, he found
that it had the gift of speech and could counsel him
wisely in all his affairs, so as soon as the ship was
ready, the figurehead was fastened to its prow, and
Jason set out on his memorable voyage. He called
his ship the <span class="locked">Argo,<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></span> and himself and his fellow adventurers
the Argonauts. Among his companions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
were many men famous for their brave deeds: Hercules,
Admetus, Castor and Pollux, Meleager, Orpheus,
and Theseus. All these were eager for new
adventures, and no one doubted that with so many
heroes to aid him, Jason would succeed in winning
the golden fleece. Even Pelias, as he watched the
voyagers sail away, wished that he had sent the
daring youth on a still more perilous journey.</p>

<p>The voyage to Colchis was full of strange happenings,
both on land and sea. The first disaster that
overtook the Argonauts occurred when Hercules
went ashore to get some fresh water, with a youth
of the party named Hylas. There had been several
occasions on which it was necessary for some of the
heroes to land in order to get food or water, but the
delay had been brief and the voyage quickly resumed.
This time they were in need of new oars, so Hercules
offered to procure them, and took with him
his favorite companion Hylas. While he himself
was felling trees, he sent Hylas in search of fresh
water; and the youth, after wandering about for
some time, came at last to a fountain whose waters
were so pure and cool that he lingered long beside
it. The nymphs who lived in the fountain were
charmed with the beauty of Hylas, and determined
to keep him with them; so when he bent over the
water, they drew him gently down into its clear
depths. Hercules, after waiting long for the lad's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
return, went in search of him; but no trace of
Hylas could be found anywhere in the lonely forest.
Though he called again and again, no voice answered
him; for Hylas lay in the green bed of the fountain,
and his ears were deaf to the cries of his friend.
Hercules's grief was so great over the loss of Hylas
that he refused to accompany the expedition any
further, and made his way home alone and on <span class="locked">foot.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></span></p>

<p>On another occasion Jason landed in Thrace;
and here he learned that the blind King Phineus
was tormented by some Harpies&mdash;creatures half
women and half bird&mdash;that ate or befouled all the
food placed before the wretched king. The only
meals Phineus could take were by stealth, and the
poor king's life was rendered miserable by the constant
presence of these foul monsters. When the
two sons of Boreas, who were happily gifted with
wings, heard Jason relate the story of the Harpies
to his companions, they promptly offered to help
the blind Phineus; and, flying at the loathsome
birds with drawn swords, the brothers drove them
out of Thrace into an island so far away that they
never came back to trouble the king.</p>

<span class="subhead">The Story of Jason</span></h2>

<h3>Part II</h3>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">Once</span>, in the course of the voyage, Jason was
attacked by a flock of brazen-feathered birds
that showered their sharp metal plumage
down on the Argonauts, and wounded some of them
sorely. Jason soon found that weapons were of no
avail against these formidable enemies, so he consulted
the figurehead that had always counseled
him wisely. In obedience to its advice the heroes
clashed their swords and spears furiously against
their shields until the birds, terrified by the noise,
flew away and never returned.</p>

<p>When the Argo approached the Symplegades,&mdash;or
Clashing Islands,&mdash;Jason remembered the words
of Phineus, who had advised him to let free a dove,
whose speed was less than that of his swift vessel,
before he attempted a passage. If it flew easily
between the rocks, then the ship could safely follow
it with no chance of being ground to pieces as the
islands clashed together. When the Argonauts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
reached this dangerous spot, Jason sent a dove out
before him. He watched its flight anxiously, and
when it glided between the rocks with only a tail
feather caught, he guided the ship so close behind it
that, as he slid through the opening made by the
rebound of the islands, the deadly rocks merely
grazed his rudder. Since their destructive power
depended on allowing no vessel to pass them
unharmed, the evil force that the islands possessed
was now broken, and they were henceforth chained
fast to the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>At last the Argo reached the shores of Colchis,
and Jason made known to King Æetes his desire to
possess the golden fleece. The owner of that wonderful
pelt was very naturally not ready to give it to
even the boldest stranger; but he treated the Argonauts
kindly, and even promised to bestow upon
Jason the coveted fleece if he could catch and harness
to a plow two brazen-hoofed, fire-breathing
bulls. Then, having done this, he must plow up
a certain piece of ground sacred to Mars, and sow
the field with dragon's teeth just as Cadmus had
<span class="locked">done.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></span> Last of all he must conquer the armed
giants that would spring up in the field after the
sowing, and then slay the dragon that guarded the
golden fleece. This was certainly enough to daunt
any hero, but Jason, relying on the help of Juno,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
agreed to the king's terms and went down to the
seashore, where his ship lay, to consult the figurehead
who had never yet failed him. On the way
he met Medea, the king's daughter, who was much
taken with the young stranger's beauty, and hoped
to induce him to marry her. Medea herself was
very beautiful, and being also a sorceress she was an
invaluable ally in the adventure that had brought
Jason and his friends from a far-distant land. So
before many days had passed Medea plighted her
troth to the young hero who needed help sorely and
the king's daughter promised to give him the aid of
her magic arts.</p>

<p>On the day appointed for the great task, Jason
boldly approached the fire-breathing bulls, for
Medea had given him a charm by which the fierce
brutes were rendered harmless, and were easily yoked
and harnessed to the plow. Then, in the presence
of the astonished spectators, who expected to see
him crushed beneath the brazen hoofs, Jason plowed
the field; and having sown it with dragon's teeth,
stood ready, sword in hand, to meet the attack of
the giants who sprang up out of the ground clad in
full armor. When he saw the glittering spears
turned toward him, Jason's heart began to quail lest,
after all, Medea's help should prove ineffective;
and even the sorceress herself felt a momentary
doubt of her own power to save her lover from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
foes. As the armed men were about to rush upon
him, Jason threw a stone in their midst, according
to Medea's instructions, and the giants turned
against each other and began a furious battle that
ended in the destruction of the whole armed host.</p>

<p>Then the hero, accompanied by Medea, hastened
to the tree where the golden fleece hung, and here a
charm was needed to lull to sleep the dragon that
guarded the treasure. As soon as the great eyes
that had never been known to close began to shut
one by one, Jason stepped softly up behind the monster
and cut off its head. It was but a moment's
work to tear the fleece from the tree where it had
hung for so many years, and to bear it in triumph
to the Argo, where Jason's friends stood anxiously
awaiting his coming. The men were already at the
oars, for he had told them to be ready to sail at a
moment's notice when he should appear bearing the
golden fleece. In spite of Æetes's promise the hero
did not trust him, and so made his preparations for
departure very secretly. When he and Medea
boarded the Argo with their prize, the rowers bent
with all their strength to the oars, and the ship slid
silently and swiftly out of the harbor.</p>

<p>Æetes soon learned that the Grecian vessel had
left his shores, carrying on board the golden fleece,
his daughter, and&mdash;worst of all&mdash;his only son
and heir Absyrtus; so he hurriedly manned his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
royal barge with rowers, and set out after the
Argonauts. Although the fugitive vessel made
good speed, the king's ship began to gain on it;
and as Jason watched the distance between the
vessels growing less and less, he was filled with
despair and begged the sorceress to aid them with
her magic. Medea did not care what fate befell
the Argonauts, but she had no desire to leave Jason
and return to her father's court; so she did not
hesitate to resort to any means of preventing the
king from overtaking her. She therefore killed
her brother Absyrtus, and, cutting his body into
pieces, dropped them one by one over the side of
the vessel. Æetes, seeing the remains of his only
son floating on the water, stopped to collect them
so that the body might have suitable burial; and
by this delay the Argonauts were allowed to escape.
The wretched king then returned to Colchis, where
he buried Absyrtus with prayers to the gods to
bring vengeance upon his inhuman daughter.</p>

<p>When the Argo with its triumphant crew reached
Thessaly, they found that their arrival caused great
surprise as well as joy, for King Pelias had never
supposed they would return, and felt himself secure
against any further trouble from the youth with
only one sandal. He was therefore much dismayed
at seeing Jason return, especially as he came unharmed
and bearing so rich a trophy as the golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
fleece. The usurper knew that his days of power
were over, and when Jason again demanded the
kingdom in his father's name, Pelias was forced
to resign his throne to the lawful king. Old Æson
was then summoned from his place of banishment,
and restored to his rightful place; but he was so
weak and decrepit that power had no charm for him,
and he accepted his throne very reluctantly.</p>

<p>So Jason begged his wife to use her magic in
behalf of the old king; and Medea, anxious to
please her lover, willingly promised to restore Æson
to all the vigor of manhood. To prepare the
magic potion that was to bring youth and health,
the sorceress went out into the meadows on nine
successive nights beginning with the new moon,
and gathered herbs whose magic properties she
alone could tell. Then she set a caldron in the
deepest part of the woods, and built under it a slow
fire that burned always night and day. In the
caldron she threw the magic herbs, flowers with
acrid juice, stones from the far east and sand from
the all-surrounding ocean, hoar frost gathered by
moonlight, a screech-owl's head and wings, and
the entrails of a wolf. Then she added some bits
of tortoise shell and the liver of a stag&mdash;for these
animals are tenacious of life&mdash;and the head and
beak of a crow that outlives nine generations of
men. All these she boiled <span class="locked">together,<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></span> stirring them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
with an olive branch; and when she lifted out the
branch, it was full of new leaves and heavy with
young olives. These preparations being finished,
and the time being full moon, Medea went forth
alone into the forest with old Æson, just at midnight
when all creatures slept, and no breath of wind
stirred the trees. She laid the old man on a bed
of herbs, and after putting him into a deep sleep,
cut his throat and let out the sluggish blood of age.
Then she poured into the wound the juices from
her caldron; and when these began to flow through
the king's weak frame, he underwent a wonderful
change, for his hair and beard lost their whiteness
and took on the glossy hue of youth. His paleness
changed to the ruddiness of manhood; and his
feeble limbs felt all the vigor of a hero in his prime.</p>

<div id="ip_276" class="figcenter" style="width: 333px;"><img src="images/i276.jpg" width="333" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">Medea</div></div>

<p>When the daughters of Pelias saw this miracle
of old Æson transformed into a stalwart man, they
begged Medea to use her magic in restoring their
father to his former youthfulness; and the sorceress
promised to help Pelias just as she had the father
of Jason. So she prepared a caldron full of boiling
water, and pretended to put into it the necessary
ingredients for the magic potion; but when the
devoted, though too-credulous daughters of Pelias
killed their father, and put his body into the caldron,
as Medea had directed, they did not restore him
to youth, but merely ended very effectively the
life that they so ardently wished to prolong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
Though Medea's great beauty and her power
as a sorceress kept Jason faithful to her for many
years, he at last grew weary of her and prepared
to wed a maiden named <span class="locked">Creusa.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></span> Pretending to
approve of his choice, and concealing her rage
at Jason's heartlessness, Medea sent the bride a
beautiful, though poisoned, robe. The unsuspicious
Creusa was delighted with this rich gift; but
as soon as it rested on her shoulders the hapless
maiden was seized with terrible convulsions, from
which she shortly died. Then Medea killed with
her own hands the children that she had borne to
Jason&mdash;so that she might have no reminder of his
falseness&mdash;and fled in her dragon-car to Athens,
where she sought the protection of King Ægeus,
the father of Theseus. Here she lived many
years, for the king, not knowing her history, and
being enamored of her beauty, married her and
made her his queen.</p>

<p>Jason, filled with remorse and despair, now led
a most unhappy life, and spent most of his time
on the seashore beside the great hulk of the Argo,
which was slowly rotting away on the beach. One
day a sudden gale detached a loose beam from
the vessel, and it fell on Jason's head, killing him
instantly. Thus ended forever the voyages of the
Argonauts.</p>

<span class="subhead">The Calydonian Hunt</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">One</span> of the heroes of the Argonautic expedition
was Meleager, son of Œneus and
Althæa, king and queen of Calydon. When
Meleager was born, his mother saw in a vision the
three Fates spinning the thread of her child's life;
and she heard them foretell that he would live
until the brand then burning on the hearth should
be consumed. Althæa, terrified by the vision,
awoke; and snatching the brand from the fire she
plunged it into an earthen jar full of water. When
she saw that the last spark was extinguished, she
carefully hid the brand on whose existence depended
the life of her son. Meleager, thus saved from
death, grew up into splendid and vigorous manhood,
and was welcomed by Jason as a fitting companion
for the famous voyage to Colchis.</p>

<p>While his son was absent on this expedition,
Œneus offended Diana by omitting to offer to her
the customary yearly sacrifice; so the angry goddess
sent a fierce boar to devastate the country. This
creature was of such enormous size and strength
that no hunters dared attack it, and it laid waste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
the fields of Calydon by trampling on the young
corn, rooting up vines and olive trees, and devouring
flocks and herds, thus creating wild confusion among
the panic-stricken people. When Meleager returned
from his voyage, and learned of the disaster
that had overtaken the land, he summoned a band
of heroes and set out to slaughter the wild boar.
Jason, Nestor, Telamon the father of Ajax, Theseus
and his friend Pirithous, Peleus (afterwards the
father of Achilles), the twin brothers Castor and
Pollux on their snow-white horses&mdash;all these and
many others came at Meleager's call to join in the
hunt.</p>

<p>With the youths came also Atalanta, daughter of
Jasius, king of Arcadia. This princess had been left
when an infant on Mount Parthenium, and exposed
to the hunger of wild beasts, for her father was
angry at finding that the gods had sent him a
daughter instead of the longed-for son. Atalanta
was not devoured, however, nor did she perish from
cold, for a kindly she-bear nursed the deserted infant,
and she grew up strong and fearless. Later on
some shepherds found the sturdy little maiden in
the woods; and taking her to their rude home, they
cared for her, and taught her to follow the chase.
Thus she had grown up like a boy, fearless, bold,
and skilled beyond most youths in the use of the
bow and spear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
When the company of heroes saw Atalanta ready
to join them in the chase for the wild boar, they
were disposed to scoff at the idea of a maiden taking
part in an adventure whose dangers might make a
brave man fearful; but Meleager, won by Atalanta's
beauty, welcomed her eagerly, and begged her to
share in the hunt. Then the company set forth
into the forest, and they did not have to wait long
for their quarry, for, as soon as the wild boar heard
the barking of the dogs and the sound of snorting
steeds, he rushed out of his lair and savagely attacked
the hunters. One after another of the
heroes was gored by the boar's long tusks, or thrown
down and trampled on by the cruel hoofs, or put to
flight. Jason threw his spear, but it only grazed
the boar's side. Telamon rushed forward, but
stumbled over a projecting root and fell to the
ground. Nestor, thrown headlong by a furious attack
from the boar, sought safety in the branches of
a tree. Theseus hurled his lance, but it was caught
by a bough and turned aside. Then an arrow from
Atalanta's bow pierced the brute's side, and blood
flowed from the wound. The infuriated boar
turned savagely upon her, but Meleager, who was
ever near the maiden, hurled his spear with so true
an aim that the boar fell dead upon the bloody and
trampled ground.</p>

<p>Then the heroes crowded around Meleager, congratulating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
him on his victory; but he refused to
accept the honor of having slain the boar, and gave
to Atalanta its head and rough hide as trophies belonging
to the victor. His companions were angered
that such honor should be given a mere girl, and
they feared the scorn and ridicule that would be
heaped upon them when they returned to report
the success of the hunt. Meleager, however, did
not heed their murmured threats, nor did he listen
to the reproaches of his two uncles, Plexippus and
Toxeus, who had accompanied him. To see themselves
thus rivaled by a boyish girl was too humiliating
for the pride of these two princes; and they
began to insult Atalanta by chiding her for joining
in the sports of men, and showing such unmaidenly
boldness. Then they attempted to snatch from her
the trophies of the hunt; and at this Meleager, who
had been incensed at their taunts to Atalanta, turned
upon them in a blaze of fury, and killed them both
with his sword.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Althæa had heard that the boar was
slain, and was on her way to the temple with a
thank-offering when news was brought her that her
two brothers had been killed&mdash;and by the hand of
her son. Then the sister's desire for vengeance
crowded out of her heart the mother's love for her
son; and she brought out of its place of concealment
the brand on whose existence depended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
Meleager's life. She lit a fire, and then hesitated
for a moment whether to commit this dreadful deed
or not; but the thought of her murdered brothers
hardened her heart, and she threw the brand into
the fire. As the flames wrapped around it, Althæa
fancied that she heard it give a groan and, seized
with remorse, she was about to snatch it from the
fire, but the memory of her dead brothers stayed her
hand, and she sat by the fire watching the flames
consume the brand. While this was going on,
Meleager suddenly felt his body seized with deadly
pangs; and, though not knowing the cause, he was
certain that his death was at hand. Then, like a
brave man and a warrior, he lamented that he must
die in this mysterious way and not meet his death
fighting like the heroes of old. He called upon
his mother and father, upon his sisters, and upon his
loved Atalanta, but no one could save him from his
fate. When the last bit of the brand fell into the
ashes, Meleager died; and his mother, now filled
with horror and remorse at her deed, committed
suicide.</p>

<p>Atalanta, having won fame and the spoils of a
celebrated hunt, was now welcomed at her father's
court and returned there to live. But though she
spent much time at the palace, she could not be
induced to give up the chase, and roamed the forests
as before, glorying in her freedom. Her father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
could not persuade her to marry, although many
noble suitors sought her hand; for an oracle had
once warned her that marriage would be her ruin.
To her father's continued insistence she at last
returned this answer&mdash;that she would wed the
suitor who could beat her in a foot-race; but the
conditions of the race were to be that the runner, if
defeated, should lose his life. Rather than accept
these terms, many of the suitors withdrew; but
some remained to run the race, for the maiden's
beauty was worth a great venture. None of them,
however, succeeded in beating the fleet-footed
Atalanta; and each man paid the price of defeat with
his life. In vain the old king implored his daughter
to alter the hard conditions, but Atalanta was determined
never to wed.</p>

<p>At one of the races a youth named <span class="locked">Hippomenes<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></span>
was made the judge; and when he learned the terms
of the contest, he turned to the competitors and
asked them why they were so foolish as to risk their
lives for the sake of a maiden's beauty. As he was
speaking, Atalanta appeared dressed for the race, and
when he looked at her, Hippomenes said: "Pardon
me, youths, I knew not the prize you were contending
for." When the race was over, and the defeated
runners put to death, Hippomenes, undaunted by
this result, boldly asked that he might try his fate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
Atalanta looked at him pityingly, for he was a youth
of noble bearing, and she felt a strange reluctance to
see him go so blithely to his death. She would not
admit to herself that she could fall in love so quickly
with a stranger; and yet she half hoped that in this
race she would not come first to the goal. As
Hippomenes prepared himself for the running, she
thought: "What unkind god wishes to bring
disaster upon this youth, and commands him, at the
risk of a life so dear, to seek this marriage. In my
own opinion I am not of such great value. It is
not his beauty that moves me, though he is good to
look upon, but I pity him because he is still a boy.
He himself cannot affect my sympathies, but his
youth moves <span class="locked">me."<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></span> Then she tried to persuade
Hippomenes to give up the race; but the more he
looked at Atalanta, the more determined he was to
win her, and he demanded the right to compete
alone with the fleet-footed maiden.</p>

<p>Reluctantly Atalanta prepared for the race, and as
Hippomenes waited eagerly for the sound of the
trumpet he breathed an ardent prayer to Venus to
help him win the peerless maiden. Venus, the
patroness of lovers, heard his prayer, and, unseen by
any watchers, slipped into his hand three golden
apples gathered from a wonderful tree on her own
island of Cyprus. When the signal was given for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
the start, each runner shot forward like an arrow
from the bow; but Atalanta soon outdistanced her
lover, and his fate seemed assured; but just as she
passed him he threw in front of her a golden apple,
and the maiden, surprised at this unexpected interruption,
stopped to pick it up. Hippomenes pressed
eagerly forward, but Atalanta soon overtook him and
as she sped by him he tossed another golden apple
in her path. Caught by its glitter the maiden
stooped again, and while she paused to recover the
apple, Hippomenes shot ahead. This advantage
was soon lost, however, for again Atalanta outran
him and was speeding past him toward the goal.
Then the lover, with another prayer to Venus, threw
the third golden apple; but by this time the maiden
had begun to fear that she might be beaten by the
handsome stranger, and so hesitated to stop for the
tempting golden fruit. Venus impelled her, however,
to pause long enough to snatch the apple
quickly from the ground, and in that moment's
delay Hippomenes passed her and reached the
<span class="locked">goal.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></span></p>

<p>Thus for the first time the race was won by
another than Atalanta, and Hippomenes claimed the
maiden as his rightful reward. Triumphantly he carried
off his prize, and for a long time he and Atalanta
were so happy that the words of the oracle seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
unlikely to be fulfilled; but unfortunately the lovers
forgot to do honor to Venus, and the goddess was
so angered at their ingratitude that she caused them
to give offense to Cybele (Rhea) by desecrating her
sacred grove. To punish them for this impiety,
Cybele changed them into a lion and lioness, and
yoked them to her car, which they were ever
afterward compelled to draw.</p>

<span class="subhead">Theseus</span></h2>

<h3>Part I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Theseus</span> was among the heroes who joined
Jason in the famous Argonautic expedition;
and he also accompanied Meleager on the
Calydonian hunt. Thus it seems that he was well-known
throughout Greece for a brave and daring
youth who was ready to follow his friends into any
adventure, no matter how dangerous. When Theseus
was a mere child, his father Ægeus, king of
Athens, went on a journey to some distant country,
taking with him his wife Æthra and his little son.
He returned alone to Athens, leaving Theseus and
his mother in the stranger's land; but before he
departed he hid his sword and sandals under a large
rock, and bade Æthra leave them there until she
deemed her son strong enough to raise the stone.
If Theseus proved equal to the test, he was to take
the sword and sandals and go straightway to his
father's court at Athens, where he would be acknowledged
as the king's son and heir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
Æthra carefully obeyed these instructions, and
when the time came that she considered Theseus
strong enough to meet his father's test, she led him
to the rock and bade him raise it. With a mighty
effort the youth lifted the huge stone, and to his
surprise he found beneath it a pair of sandals and a
fine sword&mdash;both so perfectly preserved that they
might have been placed there only the day before.
Then Æthra explained the presence of these gifts,
and told her son how the king, his father, had placed
them there beneath the rock, so that he might know
whether Theseus was to be a future hero or a weakling.
While his mother was speaking, the youth
eagerly girded on the bright sword and put the
sandals on his feet, and he needed no urging when
Æthra bade him set out at once for his father's kingdom.
She warned him of the perils that beset the
road to Athens, for giants and robbers would bar his
way, and many other dangers lay in wait for the
traveler; but Theseus was young and fearless, and
he would have faced greater dangers than these to
reach King Ægeus and the wonderful city of Athens.</p>

<p>He had gone but a few miles on his journey,
when he was accosted by the giant Periphetes, son
of Vulcan, who stood in the road, with his huge club
in his hand and refused to let Theseus pass. When
the young hero pushed boldly forward, Periphetes
raised his club to strike the youth to the ground, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
he had done many another wayfarer; but as he
lifted his arm for the blow, Theseus plunged his
sword quickly into the giant's side, and Periphetes
fell dead upon the very roadway where he had been
for so long a terror to all travelers.</p>

<p>Elated with his victory, Theseus took the stout club
of his fallen enemy and continued his journey to the
Isthmus of Corinth, where he found that the road
soon grew very narrow and led along the edge of a
rocky precipice. Here he encountered a famous
robber named Sciron, who compelled all those who
passed his way to wash his feet. When the terrified
traveler, unable to refuse, was thus occupied, the
robber would suddenly raise his foot and kick the
man over the side of the cliff into the sea below,
where a hungry tortoise lay waiting with ever-open
jaws. When Theseus was told the condition on
which he would be allowed to pass, he drew his
sword and set upon his enemy so fiercely that Sciron
quickly withdrew his demand, and offered to let the
hero go on his way undisturbed. Then Theseus, as
he held his sword point at the robber's throat, commanded
Sciron to perform the same menial task that
he had set so many others; and when the robber,
not daring to refuse, was kneeling before him, Theseus
hurled him over the precipice and gave one more
meal to the hungry tortoise, who never again was
able to feast on the bodies of luckless travelers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
The next adventure that befell the hero was with
a cruel giant called Sinis, or the Pine-Bender, because
he delighted in bending over some tall pine-tree
until its top reached the ground; and having done
this, he would call to some unsuspicious passer-by
to help him hold it down. The stranger usually complied
with this request, and then the giant would
take his great hand from the tree, which would at
once spring back to its upright position, hurling the
unfortunate helper into the air, and often dashing
him to pieces against the rocks. When Theseus
encountered the giant and was asked for his help,
he remembered that his mother had told him long
ago of this brutal giant's jest, and he determined
that travelers should no more be killed or even
terrorized by this curse of the highway. So when
Sinis bent down a particularly large and strong
pine-tree and begged Theseus to help him hold it,
the hero deftly fastened the giant himself to the
tree which sprang upward as soon as it was released
and dashed the huge body against the mountain
side, crushing it to pieces.</p>

<p>After disposing of the giant, Theseus continued
his journey and next encountered Procrustes (called
the Stretcher), a fearful giant who, under the pretense
of hospitality, lured travelers into his house. Though
an offer of food and entertainment was so unusual
that it might have aroused suspicion, most of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
who passed Procrustes's house accepted his invitation
and entered. In the house was an iron bedstead on
which the giant forced all his guests to lie. If they
were too short, he stretched their limbs to suit the
size of the bed; and if they were too long, he cut off
their legs to make them fit its dimensions. Theseus
entered Procrustes's home, and partook freely of the
food set before him. Then he suddenly fell upon
the giant, who was unprepared for such an attack,
bound him to his own bedstead, and by making his
huge body fit into it, inflicted on Procrustes the
same cruel death that he had delighted to visit on
others.</p>

<p>When Theseus finally reached Athens, he went
straightway to the palace, and on his way he learned
that his father had married the sorceress Medea.
When he arrived at the royal apartments and came
before Ægeus, his cloak so completely hid his sword
that the king could not possibly recognize it as the
one he had left for his son. Nevertheless he welcomed
the stranger, who seemed a brave and handsome
youth, and bade him take a place at the banquet-table.
But though the king did not know whom
he was entertaining, Medea, the sorceress, was perfectly
well aware of the stranger's identity, and mixed
a deadly poison in the wine-cup that was intended
for the guest. Handing this to Ægeus, she bade
him honor the youth with a cup of their choicest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
wine; and the king, suspecting nothing, was about
to offer the poisoned drink to Theseus when he
suddenly saw the sword beneath the stranger's cloak.
Looking down at the youth's sandals, he recognized
them as the ones that he had buried under a rock
long ago, and he knew then that the sword was also
his own. With a cry of joy he started forward to
embrace his son, and as he did so the cup of wine
that he held in his hand was overturned and its contents
poured on the table. Some of the drops of
poisoned wine fell on a dog that was lying at the
king's feet, and immediately it gave one convulsive
shudder and died. Realizing that the deadly draught
had been meant for him, and knowing that only the
jealous Medea could have dared to commit such a
crime, Theseus sprang toward her with drawn sword,
intending to put an end to her wickedness; but the
sorceress fled from the banquet-hall, mounted her
dragon-car, and escaped to a distant country, which
was afterwards called by her name Media.</p>

<p>King Ægeus was delighted to find that his son
had grown to be such a brave and handsome youth,
and he listened with pride while Theseus related all
the adventures that had befallen him on the way to
Athens. Then the king made a great feast in honor
of his son, and publicly proclaimed him his heir.
The time passed very happily to Theseus until the
day when he saw a sad procession of weeping people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
wending its way through the streets, and observed
in the midst of them seven youths and seven maidens
dressed in funeral garments. He inquired where
this solemn cortège was going, and was told that
the casting of lots had just been concluded and the
victims had been chosen for the Minotaur. Then the
young prince learned for the first time that since
Minos, king of Crete, had conquered the Athenians
in a recent war, he had exacted of them a terrible
tribute. Each year seven youths and seven maidens
were offered to the <span class="locked">Minotaur,<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></span> an insatiable monster
that dwelt in an intricate labyrinth built for its special
use by King Minos, and designed by the celebrated
architect Dædalus.</p>

<p>The labyrinth was so intricate that no one who
entered it could ever hope to find his way out; and
the victims which Athens supplied each year were
probably killed by terror and suspense as they
threaded their way through the labyrinth's tortuous
windings, long before the fearful Minotaur came
upon them. The architect who designed this wonderful
cave should have earned the lasting gratitude
of Minos; but Dædalus unfortunately lost the
king's favor, and for some slight offense was shut
up in a tower with his son Icarus. The boy gave
himself up for lost, but the father began at once
to contrive some means of escape, and ingeniously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
fashioned two pairs of wings, which were to gain
freedom for himself and his son. When the last
feather was adjusted, Dædalus fastened one pair of
wings securely on Icarus, and cautioned him not to
fly too high lest the heat of the sun should melt the
wax with which the feathers were held together.
The youth, impatient to be free, paid slight attention
to these warnings; and as soon as his wings were
fastened, he sprang boldly from the tower window and
flew straight toward the clouds. Higher and higher
he rose, exulting in this glorious motion, and soon
the heat of the sun's rays began to soften the wax
on his wings. When it was too late, Icarus realized
his danger and came nearer to the earth; but the
wax was melting fast, and in a moment the feathers
separated and the adventurous boy was plunged
headlong into the sea. His body was never recovered,
but that part of the sea was afterwards called
the Icarian Sea. Dædalus enjoyed a happier fate
than that of his son, for he reached Sicily in safety
and built a temple there to Apollo. In the temple
he hung up his wings as an offering to the <span class="locked">god.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></span></p>

<span class="subhead">Theseus</span></h2>

<h3>Part II</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">When</span> Theseus heard the story of the
Minotaur and its wonderful labyrinth,
he determined that it should no longer
exact its yearly tribute of human lives, for he would
offer himself as one of the victims and end the terrible
sacrifice by slaying the monster. When he announced
this intention to his father, the king sought
to persuade him to remain at home; but Theseus
joined the youths and maidens who had been chosen
by lot to go to Crete, and they set sail for the country
of the Minotaur. According to the custom, the
ship hoisted only black sails, which Theseus promised
to change for white ones when he returned
unharmed, having slain the monster.</p>

<p>Nothing befell the voyagers until they reached
the coast of Crete, but here the ship was stopped by
the giant Talus, whose body was made of brass and
was always so red hot that if he held any one in his
embrace, the victim was burnt to cinders. This
giant was a very effective guardian of the island, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
kept off all strangers who had no business along
that coast. As he knew that the black-sailed ship
brought to his master, King Minos, the yearly
tribute from the Athenians, he let the vessel pass;
and the voyagers, having landed, were led before
the king. The cruel mouth of Minos relaxed
into a smile when he saw the youths and maidens,
for they were all young and beautiful,&mdash;the very
flower of the Athenians,&mdash;and it gave him special
satisfaction to consign such a chosen company to
death. Beside Minos stood his daughter Ariadne,
who looked compassionately at those who were
destined for the sacrifice, and when she saw Theseus,
she pitied him above all the rest, and wished she
might save him from his loathsome fate.</p>

<p>When the young hero asked that he might go
first into the labyrinth, and alone, King Minos
smiled at what he considered a child's boast&mdash;for
he had heard that Theseus hoped to slay the Minotaur;
but when he learned that the bold youth was
his enemy's only son, he gladly allowed him to do
as he wished, although it was contrary to all custom.
Theseus was therefore placed alone in a cell of the
prison, and here he did not feel quite so bold or so
eager to face the Minotaur as he had when he talked
over the adventure at his father's court. His sword
had been taken away, and he had no other weapon
with which to fight the monster, so his confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
was somewhat shaken; and as he watched the night
deepening the gloom of his prison, he felt disheartened
and almost unnerved for his coming battle.
Just then the door of the prison opened softly, and
Ariadne, the king's daughter, entered. To Theseus's
great surprise she gave him a sharp sword and a ball
of thread&mdash;two things that she assured him were
necessary for him to have if he hoped to come alive
out of the labyrinth. She bade him fasten one end
of the thread to the entrance of the cave, and keep
the ball tight in his hand, so that it might lead him
back through the intricate windings after he had
slain the Minotaur.</p>

<p>Theseus was very grateful to Ariadne for her assistance,
without which he would never have been
able to encounter the monster or to escape from its
wonderful labyrinth. He assured the maiden that
his father would send her a generous reward of gold
and jewels; but she refused to accept any return
for her kindness until Theseus ventured to suggest
that if she would become his wife, he would be
proud to take her back with him to Athens. To
this Ariadne gladly agreed, and they plighted their
troth in the murky darkness of the prison. When
at dawn of the following day the hero, now full of
courage and sure of success, was led to the labyrinth,
he fastened one end of the thread to the entrance.
Then, with his hand on his sword, which was hidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
under his long cloak, he stepped boldly into the
cave from which no human being had ever come
out alive. The passage was narrow and dark,
and strewn everywhere with whitening bones, so
Theseus stepped very cautiously, with his ball of
thread held fast and his hand ever ready on his
sword. Suddenly the Minotaur rushed upon him
at an unlooked-for turn in the road, and though the
hero had no warning of its presence he met it
boldly. A terrible battle ensued, in which Theseus
struck fiercely at the Minotaur, wounding it mortally,
while the pain-maddened brute tore gashes in his
flesh and almost suffocated him with its deadly
breath. At last the hero gave a swift thrust with
his sword that cut through the monster's great head,
and in a moment the Minotaur lay dead among the
bones of its former victims.</p>

<p>With the help of the thread, which he had never
lost, even in the thick of the fight, Theseus was
able to retrace his steps and to reach the entrance to
the labyrinth, where he found Ariadne anxiously
awaiting him. At the sight of the blood-stained
sword she knew that her lover had slain the Minotaur,
and together they hurried to the black-sailed
ship, to which Ariadne had already conveyed the
youths and maidens who had been Theseus's companions
on the voyage. As quickly as possible the ship
sped out of the harbor; but before they could quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
clear the Cretan shores, the giant Talus came upon
them, and, seeing that some of his master's prisoners
were escaping, he tried to catch hold of the vessel
by its rigging. As he leaned forward to do this,
Theseus dealt him such a mighty blow that he toppled
over into the sea and was drowned. At this spot
there were later discovered some thermal springs,
which gave evidence of the terrible heat in the giant's
brazen body.</p>

<p>Only once did the vessel stop on its swift voyage
homeward, and this was at the island of Naxos.
Here the whole company landed to explore the
beauties of the island, and to find some spring from
which to get a supply of fresh water. Ariadne wandered
apart from the gay company, and being
weary, threw herself down on the bank of a stream
to rest. Here she fell fast asleep, and when Theseus
later found her there, he at once conceived the
treacherous idea of deserting her. So he summoned
all his companions, and went stealthily down to the
ship, where he embarked, leaving Ariadne alone on
the island. For some days the deserted maiden sat
on the seashore watching in vain for the Athenian
ship to return; but she did not mourn her faithless
lover long, for the gods sent her a greater happiness
than she could ever have had with the fickle Theseus.
The island of Naxos was the favorite spot of
Bacchus, god of wine, who landed one day with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
merry company of followers, and found the weeping
Ariadne. In a short time he won her love and confidence,
and persuaded her to be his wife. The
wedding celebrations so occupied Ariadne's mind
that the treacherous Theseus was soon <span class="locked">forgotten.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></span></p>

<p>The Athenians had been so eager to return to
their native city that they had no thought but to
reach home as quickly as the vessel could bear them;
and Theseus forgot his promise to his father that,
in case of success, white sails should replace the
black ones that were hoisted on the outgoing voyage.
Old Ægeus went each day to the seashore, and
stood on a high rock, watching the sea for some sign
of the returning ship. When, at last, he saw it
loom up on the horizon, with its black sails showing
ominously against the sky, he at once concluded
that his son was dead; and in his grief over this
great loss he threw himself into the water, which has
since been known as the Ægean Sea.</p>

<p>When Theseus entered Athens in triumph, the
first news he heard was the tidings of his father's
death; and realizing that it had occurred through
his forgetfulness, he was filled with remorse. Though
this misfortune made him king of Athens, he allowed
the city no rejoicings on his accession to the
throne; and the power and wealth at his command
gave him no happiness, for his conscience still accused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
him of causing his father's death. He tried
to divert his mind by absorbing himself in state
duties, but soon found that nothing would bring
forgetfulness as long as he stayed in Athens; so he
set out again in search of adventures, and led an
expedition against the Amazons, who had been harassing
his land. After a long and fierce battle he
defeated them and took their queen, Antiope, prisoner.
The Amazons then attacked Athens, and
penetrated into the heart of the city, but were
finally driven out. Shortly after this Theseus
married the queen, <span class="locked">Antiope,<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></span> and a son was born
to them whom the delighted father named Hippolytus.
When, later on, the Amazons again made
an invasion into the country under the pretext of
rescuing their queen, Antiope was killed by an
arrow sent at random into the court of the palace.</p>

<p>The next adventure in which Theseus engaged
was to lead the Athenian army against Pirithous,
king of the Lapithæ, who had been secretly carrying
off some of his herds. Full of anger at these
continued plunderings, Theseus came suddenly upon
the marauders as they were boldly making off with
their booty; but as soon as he and Pirithous were
brought face to face, they were seized with such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
admiration for each other that they had no longer
any feelings of enmity. They threw down their weapons,
clasped each other's hands, and swore eternal
friendship. To prove his devotion to his new friend,
Theseus agreed to accompany him to the court of
Adrastus, king of Argos, and to be present at the
marriage of Pirithous to Hippodamia, the daughter
of the king. Many guests came to the wedding,
and among them were Hercules and a number of the
centaurs. The beauty of the bride so won the admiration
of the centaurs that they determined to
kidnap her, and a terrible battle ensued between
them and the Lapithæ, who were aided by Theseus
and Hercules. Finally the centaurs were driven
away, but not before many of them had been killed
or wounded. The bride who had been the cause of
this strenuous fighting did not live long, however,
and Pirithous soon found himself like Theseus, a
disconsolate widower.</p>

<div id="ip_302" class="figcenter" style="width: 462px;"><img src="images/i302.jpg" width="462" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">Theseus</div></div>

<p>Having been so unfortunate in their wives, the
two heroes determined not to seek again any king's
daughters in marriage, but to choose some one of
divine parentage. So Theseus decided upon Helen,
the child of Jupiter and <span class="locked">Leda<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></span> whom the ruler of the
gods wooed in the form of a snow-white swan.
Pirithous's choice fell upon Proserpina, the wife of
Pluto. Theseus succeeded in carrying off Helen;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
but as she was at that time a mere child, he left her
in the care of his mother Æthra until she should
be old enough for marriage. Meanwhile Helen's
twin brothers, Castor and Pollux, having discovered
who her abductor was, waited until he was absent
on the venture with his friend Pirithous, and then
went to the rescue of their sister, whom they took
forcibly from Æthra, and carried triumphantly home
to Sparta.</p>

<p>Of these twin brothers, Castor was mortal, and
some time later was slain in battle. Pollux, who was
immortal, then begged Jupiter to let him die also,
that he might not be separated from his brother.
The ruler of Olympus, touched by this evidence of
devotion, allowed Castor to return to life on condition
that Pollux would spend half of his time in
Hades. Later on both brothers were translated to
the heavens, where they form a bright constellation,
one of the signs of the <span class="locked">Zodiac.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></span></p>

<p>Although Theseus's attempt to win an immortal
bride was unsuccessful, the two friends were not discouraged;
and the hero accompanied Pirithous to
Hades when he made the bold attempt to carry off
Proserpina. Pluto, having discovered their intention,
was so enraged at the insult that he fastened
Theseus to an enchanted rock, and bound Pirithous
to the ever-revolving wheel of his father Ixion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
When Hercules went down to Hades to ask Pluto's
permission to carry the three-headed dog Cerberus
to the court of <span class="locked">Eurystheus,<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></span> he freed Theseus from
the enchanted rock and thus enabled him to return
to Athens.</p>

<p>Though somewhat advanced in years Theseus
decided to marry again, and chose as his bride the
beautiful Phædra,<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> a younger sister of Ariadne.
An embassy was accordingly sent to ask for the
maiden's hand in marriage, and later she was
brought to Athens; but she was not at all pleased
with her elderly husband, and much preferred his
handsome young son Hippolytus, whose years were
better suited to her own. She tried to persuade
Hippolytus to elope with her, and when he indignantly
refused to be so disloyal to his father,
Phædra's affection for him turned to hate, and she
determined to make him pay dearly for thus scorning
her love. So she went to the king and told
him that Hippolytus was trying to persuade her to
desert the husband she adored; and the infatuated
Theseus, believing her story, vowed to punish the
youth for his treachery. Learning that his son was
then driving his chariot along the seashore, the king
implored Neptune to avenge his wrongs; and the
obliging sea-god sent a huge wave over the chariot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
which dashed it against the rocks and threw the
lifeless body of Hippolytus on the beach. When
Phædra saw what had happened as the result of
her false accusations, she was filled with remorse and
despair; and after confessing her wickedness to the
king, she hung herself. One story relates that
Diana, pitying the innocent Hippolytus, restored
him to life with the aid of Æsculapius; and, to remove
him from the power of his irresponsible father,
placed him in the care of the nymph Egeria.</p>

<p>Theseus, having grown bitter from his many
misfortunes, now became so stern and tyrannical
that his people began to hate him and to wish for
another ruler. At last, driven to desperation by
his harsh measures, they banished him to the island
of Scyros, where the king Lycomedes treated him
at first with great kindness; but he soon grew tired of
the old man's presence and decided to get rid of
him. So one day when Theseus was walking along
the cliff's edge, a servant stole up behind him and
threw him into the sea. When the Athenians heard
of the fate that had befallen their king, they repented
of having sent him into banishment; and
now, in a sudden revulsion of feeling, they made
him a national hero. Later on he was deified as a
sort of demigod; his bones were brought piously
back to Athens; and a magnificent temple was
erected in his honor on the Acropolis.</p>

<span class="subhead">Œdipus</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">Laius</span> and Jocasta, king and queen of Thebes,
were very happy when the gods gave them
a little son, and they sent to the oracle at
Delphi to learn what auspicious omens attended the
child's birth. To their horror they were informed
that the boy would kill his father, marry his mother,
and bring great misfortune upon his native city.</p>

<p>Hoping to avert this dreadful calamity, Laius
commanded a servant to take the child away and
kill him; but the man, not wishing to commit so
heartless a crime, hung the infant by his ankles to a
tree, and left him there to perish of hunger or from
the teeth of wild beasts. The king, believing that
his command had been carried out and that the boy
no longer lived, was happy in the conviction that
the oracle would never be fulfilled. Meanwhile the
helpless child was left hanging to the tree until a
shepherd, chancing to pass by, heard his pitiful cries
and went to his rescue. The kindly peasant then
carried the infant to his master Polybus, king of
Corinth, who befriended the little stranger and later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
adopted him as his son and heir, for he had no children
of his own. He called the boy Œdipus, which
means swollen-foot.</p>

<p>The young prince grew up in entire ignorance of
his real parentage, and never suspected that he was
not king Polybus's son until one day, at the royal
banquet, a guest, drunk with wine, was heartless
enough to tell him that he was only an adopted
child. At first Œdipus believed this statement to be
just a malicious invention; but as he saw the glances
that the other guests exchanged, he was filled with
dread lest the words might be really true. So he
went in haste to the woman he had always called his
mother, and demanded the truth about his birth.
The queen, fearing that Œdipus might kill himself
if he knew that he had been deceived about his
parentage, assured him that he was indeed her son.
The youth believed her repeated assertions, and yet
he was not wholly satisfied; so he went to consult
the oracle at Delphi. From this he could learn
nothing but the terrible prophecy that he would
kill his father, marry his mother, and bring misfortune
upon his native city.</p>

<p>Determined not to be forced into committing any
of these crimes, Œdipus fled from Corinth and became
a wanderer. Once, while he was walking on
the high-road, bewailing the cruel fat that drove
him away from the people he loved, he was met by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
a chariot in which sat an old man and his servant.
This was Laius, king of Thebes, who was journeying
thus far from his native city to consult the
oracle of Delphi. The servant who drove the
king's chariot commanded Œdipus to move out of
the road, and flourished his whip to enforce his demand.
The young prince was not accustomed to
be thus ordered about, and refused to move so that
the king's chariot might pass. The driver then struck
Œdipus with his whip, at which the youth grew so
enraged that he avenged the insult by killing the
servant with his sword. The king hurled his spear at
Œdipus and called loudly to his other servants, who
were some distance behind; but before they could
come to their master's rescue, Laius was stretched
dead in the road. Thus the first part of the prophecy
was fulfilled.</p>

<p>When the attendants came hurrying to the king's
assistance, they were horrified at finding both him and
his charioteer dead; but although they searched
everywhere, no trace of the murderer could be
found. Œdipus meanwhile had escaped and was
on his way to Thebes, whither the servants were
now preparing to carry their dead master. Though
strangers were usually noticed as they came through
the city gates, Œdipus was scarcely observed during
the many days that Thebes was in mourning
for the dead king. When the funeral ceremonies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
were over, the young stranger heard one day a
herald proclaiming in the streets that the throne of
Thebes should belong to him who could kill the
Sphinx and thus free the country from its baneful
presence. The hand of the queen Jocasta was also
promised as a further reward.</p>

<p>When Œdipus asked one of the natives what this
creature called the Sphinx might be, the old man to
whom he spoke turned on him a look of surprise,
and remarked that he must indeed be a stranger to
Thebes if he did not know that the city was suffering
from the presence of the Sphinx. This monster,
he said, was half woman and half lion, with the claws
and wings of a huge bird; and it had stationed itself
just outside the city gates, where it crouched upon a
rock so close to the high-road that no traveler could
pass it unseen, especially as it kept watch both night
and day. To each passer-by the Sphinx propounded
a riddle, and those who solved it could
pass undisturbed, but those who failed were at once
torn to pieces by the monster's claws. Thus far
no one had been able to solve the riddle, and many
travelers had already been destroyed.</p>

<p>When Œdipus heard this story, he determined to
seek the Sphinx and try his fate. Even if he himself
were slain, he would not regret having given his
life to the nation that had befriended him, especially
since the oracle had prophesied for him such a series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
of crimes that he had no love for life. So, sword in
hand, he went out of the city gates, and walked
boldly along the road to the rock where the crouching
Sphinx lay in wait for its prey. As soon as it
saw Œdipus, it stopped him, and demanded that he
should answer the riddle or else lose his life.</p>

<p>"Tell me your riddle then," cried the hero,
boldly; and the Sphinx <span class="locked">replied:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"What is it that in the morning goes on four feet,
at noon on two feet, and in the evening upon three?"</p>

<p>For some minutes Œdipus did not answer, but he
crept nearer to the Sphinx, with his sword gripped
firmly in his hand. The monster began to lick its
cruel lips, and stretch out one long claw toward its
victim, when Œdipus <span class="locked">answered:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"It is man, who in childhood creeps on hands
and knees, in manhood walks erect, and in old age
moves with the help of a staff." The Sphinx, with
a cry of rage and disappointment, spread its wings,
preparing to fly away to some other place where it
could find new victims; but Œdipus suddenly
rushed upon it with his drawn sword, and drove it
over the edge of a precipice which was so steep that
the monster was instantly killed by its fall.</p>

<p>When Œdipus returned to the city and announced
that he had slain the Sphinx, the people
greeted him as their deliverer. They placed him in
the royal chariot, proclaimed him their king, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
carried him in triumph to the palace, where the
queen Jocasta welcomed him. Shortly after this
she married Œdipus, thus fulfilling the second part
of the prophecy.</p>

<p>In spite of the crimes that he had unknowingly
committed, Œdipus reigned many years in Thebes,
and proved himself so wise and just a ruler that the
people never regretted having chosen him for their
king. Two sons were born to him and Jocasta,
and two beautiful daughters. The former were
named Eteocles and Polynices, and the latter Ismene
and Antigone. Œdipus himself was so content that
he almost disbelieved the fatal prophecy at Delphi;
but his happiness was destined to be short lived, for
the city was suddenly afflicted with a pestilence and
famine which caused such distress throughout the
land that the stricken people came flocking to Œdipus,
praying him to deliver them from the scourge.
The king sent at once to consult the oracle at
Delphi, and his messengers returned with this answer
from <span class="locked">Apollo:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Every effort was then made to discover who had
slain the former king Laius, and it was not long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
before the crime of Œdipus was revealed. At the
same time the old servant who had been commanded
to kill the infant son of Laius and Jocasta was found,
and made to confess his part in the tragedy. Œdipus
was now convinced of his real parentage, and
discovered to his horror that he had already been
guilty of the three crimes that the oracle had foretold.
In vain he had fled from Corinth to escape
being near his supposed parents; and in vain, too,
had he sought refuge in another city, believing that
the one he had left was his birthplace. When the
queen Jocasta realized the full horror of her relationship
to Œdipus, she committed suicide; and the
king, rushing into her apartment at the sound of
her cries, saw her lifeless body on the ground. In
despair at this sight Œdipus, the unwilling cause of
the tragedy, was seized with a sudden madness and
put out both his own eyes, declaring that the sunlight
would be forever hateful to him.</p>

<div id="ip_312" class="figcenter" style="width: 435px;"><img src="images/i312.jpg" width="435" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">Œdipus and Antigone</div></div>

<p>Blind, penniless, and on foot, he left the palace
and the city on which he had brought such disaster,
and wandered over the land accompanied by his
devoted daughter Antigone, who clung to the fallen
king the more lovingly because of his misery and
disgrace. After many days of wandering in the rain
and cold, begging their scanty food and resting in
any wayside spot that offered them shelter, Œdipus
and his daughter came to Colonus, a village near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
Athens. Here was a deep and almost impenetrable
forest, which the Greeks believed to be sacred to
the Furies. In this grewsome spot Œdipus declared
that he would stay the rest of his days; and bidding
his daughter farewell, he entered the dark forest
alone. Antigone, weeping and clinging to her
father's arm, besought him to let her stay beside
him, for what could he&mdash;old and blind and helpless&mdash;do
in that fearful spot but perish? Œdipus
gently released her clinging hands, and refused to
allow her to go any farther with him, assuring her that
to him who lived ever in the eternal night of blindness,
there were no terrors in the darkness of the forest.</p>

<p>So Antigone sadly returned to Athens, and the
blind king groped his way among the thick underbrush
and fallen trees. At nightfall a terrible storm
came up, and its forerunner, the wind, shook the
forest as if it were some child's toy; but still the old
king felt his way among the trees, and the lightning,
as it flashed into the dark places of the forest, illumined
a figure bent and shaking, but grim, determined,
and unafraid. The next day when the
storm was over, a party of men sent by Theseus,
king of Athens, went in search of Œdipus, but no
trace of him was ever found; and the ancients believed
that the Furies dragged him down into Hades,
where he received a fitting punishment for his <span class="locked">crimes.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
The plague having been removed from Thebes
by the death of Œdipus&mdash;according to the words
of Apollo&mdash;the city returned to its former prosperity;
and then began a fierce dispute between the
king's two sons as to which of them should succeed
to the throne. A compromise was finally agreed
upon whereby the eldest son, Eteocles, was to reign
for one year, and at the end of the year the second
son, Polynices, was to accede to the throne and rule
for the same length of time. The dispute being
settled amicably, Polynices set out for adventures in
foreign lands during his brother's reign; and at the
end of the year he returned to claim his right to
wield the scepter of power. Eteocles refused, however,
to relinquish the throne; and with the help
of the soldiers, drove Polynices out of the city.</p>

<div id="ip_314" class="figcenter" style="width: 459px;"><img src="images/i314.jpg" width="459" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">Antigone and Ismene</div></div>

<p>Furious at this treachery, but unable to retaliate
single-handed, Polynices fled to the court of
Adrastus, king of Argos, where he was hospitably
received. On relating the story of his wrongs, he
so won the sympathy of the king that the kindly
monarch promised to help him regain his kingdom.
Later on the banished prince married Adrastus's
daughter, and the king equipped a large army to
go with Polynices to Thebes. At the head of the
troops he placed seven valiant chiefs who were
determined to win the city from the usurper, or
perish in the attempt. These leaders gave this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
celebrated expedition the name of "The Seven
against Thebes."</p>

<p>If courage and boldness were enough to overthrow
a city, the besiegers would have won an easy
victory; but their bravery was of no avail against a
place so well fortified and defended as Thebes.
After a seven years' siege the leaders of the attacking
forces grew weary of espousing a hopeless cause,
and decided that the quarrel between the two
brothers must be settled by a duel. Accordingly
Polynices and Eteocles met face to face, and fought
so fiercely that both of them were killed. The only
one left in the city who could rightfully assume
the reins of authority was Creon, the father of
Jocasta, who was now proclaimed king of <span class="locked">Thebes.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></span>
By Creon's order the body of Eteocles was given
all the honors of a royal burial; but the corpse of
Polynices was left on the battle-field a prey to dogs
and vultures. Then the king issued a proclamation
that if any one dared to touch the body of the dead
prince, he would be buried alive. The friends
of Polynices did not venture to defy this edict;
but his sister Antigone, horrified at the thought
of leaving her brother's body to suffer such disgrace,
determined to ignore the king's barbarous decree.
As she was unable to procure any assistance, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
dug a grave with her own hands and buried Polynices,
performing such funeral rites for the repose of the
dead as she could accomplish alone.</p>

<p>While she was engaged in this act of devotion
she was seen by the soldiers of Creon, who dragged
her at once into the presence of the king. Although
Antigone was one of his own family, and was also
the promised wife of his son Hæmon, the relentless
monarch condemned her to death. Hæmon
pleaded with his father to spare the life of his betrothed,
since her deed, though in defiance of the
king's order, had been one of praiseworthy devotion;
but Creon would not revoke his decision, and condemned
Antigone to the most horrible of deaths&mdash;that
of being buried alive. While this inhuman
sentence was being carried out, Hæmon leaped into
the grave where Antigone was kneeling, and declared
that he would die by her side. As the
terrible process of walling-in the lovers was slowly
completed, Antigone died in Hæmon's arms; and
when he felt her lifeless body lying limp in his embrace,
he ended his own life with his dagger.</p>

<span class="subhead">The Apple of Discord</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Jupiter</span>, father of the gods, once fell in love
with the beautiful sea-nymph "Thetis of the
silver feet," the daughter of Nereus and
Doris. Before he arranged for the marriage, the
ruler of Olympus first consulted the Fates to see
whether any misfortune was likely to attend his
nuptials; and the three sisters who spin the thread
of life night and day declared that Thetis was destined
to be the mother of a son who would be far
greater than his father.</p>

<p>Although Jupiter could not imagine how any
god could supplant him in Olympus, he was nevertheless
unwilling to act in defiance of what the Fates
decreed; so he gave Thetis in marriage to Peleus,
king of Phthia, who had long loved her and had
sought her hand in vain. The sea-nymph was not
very well pleased at having to accept a mere mortal
as a husband, even though he was a king, after having
been wooed by the greatest of the gods. To
induce her to consent to the marriage, Jupiter promised
that he and the other gods would come down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
from high Olympus to attend the wedding; and the
prospect of this great honor soothed the pride of
Thetis so that she consented to marry Peleus.</p>

<p>The preparations for the wedding were begun in
the coral caves of her father Nereus, and all the
ocean-deities and sea-nymphs helped to beautify the
palace under the sea. When the wedding day arrived,
Jupiter, with all the attending gods, came to
grace the marriage feast. The guests took their
seats at the well-filled table, and pledged the bride
in brimming cups of wine. There was nothing to
mar the joy of the occasion until suddenly an uninvited
guest appeared in the banquet-hall, and the
laughter died away into an ominous silence. This
unexpected visitor was Eris (or Discordia), the goddess
of discord, who had not been asked to the wedding
because her hideous face, snaky hair, and vicious
temper made Thetis fear that her presence would
anger the other guests. The strife-breeding goddess
regarded this omission as an insult, so she went
unbidden to the marriage feast, determined to vent
her wrath and spite on those who had received the
coveted honor. For a moment she stood looking at
the assembled company with glances full of hatred,
and she laughed mockingly when she saw them
shrink away as she breathed over them her poisonous
breath. Then she threw on the table a golden
apple, and immediately vanished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
The guests were eager to see the beautiful fruit, and
as they passed it about among themselves they were
surprised to find engraved on its smooth surface the
words "For the Fairest." Immediately there arose
a lively discussion as to whom the apple should
rightfully belong; and each of the goddesses present
was inclined to believe that the fruit was intended
for her. At last all the contestants for the golden
apple withdrew their claims except Juno, Minerva,
and Venus,&mdash;each of whom disputed hotly for its
possession. Juno contended that her power and
majesty gave her the best right to the prize;
Minerva claimed that the beauty of wisdom surpassed
all other charms; while laughter-loving
Venus asked who could rightfully be called "the
fairest" if not the goddess of beauty.</p>

<p>As the dispute grew more and more bitter, the
goddesses called upon the other guests to decide their
respective claims; but no one was willing to assume
this responsibility. Since the apple could be given
to but one of the three, the other two would be sure
to vent their anger and disappointment on those who
made the decision, each believing that the judges
willfully refused to admit her superior charms. So,
at the suggestion of one of the company, the entire
wedding party adjourned to Mount Ida, where the
beautiful shepherd Paris was tending his flocks.
Jupiter appointed him to be the judge of the contest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
The bewildered shepherd took some moments
to recover from the surprise of having this
brilliant company break in upon his solitude; and
he stood watching them in awe and reverence, not
daring to speak in the presence of the immortals.</p>

<p>Paris was not, however, an uncouth peasant lad,
for although occupying the lowly position of shepherd,
he was really the son of Priam and Hecuba,
king and queen of Troy. When he was a mere
infant, he was left on the mountain to perish, because
an oracle had foretold that he would cause the death
of his family and the destruction of his native city.
But though so inhumanly exposed to cold and the
hunger of wild beasts, the child did not die, for he
was found by a shepherd, who adopted him and
brought him up to follow his own calling.</p>

<p>When Paris grew to manhood he was so handsome
that the wood-nymphs, who were his companions,
all sighed for love of him. Among them was the
fair and gentle Œnone, whom Paris secretly married,
and with whom he lived happily on Mount Ida.
Though his foster-father had told him the story of
his birth, Paris had no longing for the glitter and
grandeur of palaces, for he felt sure that king Priam
would wish to kill him if he learned that the son he
feared and hated was alive.</p>

<div id="ip_320" class="figcenter" style="width: 418px;"><img src="images/i320.jpg" width="418" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">Paris</div></div>

<p>Paris had grown so accustomed to the solitude of
the mountain that when the wedding party suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
came upon him, he stood fearful and silent while
Jupiter, showing him the golden apple with its inscription,
bade him judge which of the three goddesses
should receive it. Before he could make
any answer, Juno told him if he gave the apple to
her he would thereby win great wealth and honor.
Minerva promised him the gift of wisdom far exceeding
that of mortal men; but laughter-loving
Venus whispered in his ear that if he awarded her
the apple, he should have the most beautiful woman
in the world for his wife. Whether it was the alluring
beauty of Venus that blinded his judgment,
or the reward which she offered that tempted him, it
is impossible to tell. Perhaps it was for both of
these reasons that Paris turned quickly and placed
the coveted apple in Venus's hand. This decision
brought upon him the wrath of both the discredited
goddesses, who began from that moment to cherish
a hatred for the house of Troy, and to plot its destruction.</p>

<p>Venus told Paris that in order for her to fulfill
her promise, he must now go down to the city
of Troy and make himself known to his parents.
She assured him that he need have no fear of his
father, for she herself would so order his affairs that
the king would welcome him and acknowledge him
as his son. Later on she would arrange that he
should be furnished with ships in which to sail to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
Greece, for to this country he must inevitably go,
since Helen, wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta, was
the most beautiful woman in the world. Obeying
carefully all the instructions of the goddess, who had
now become his protectress, Paris left his shepherding
and went down to the court of his father, King
Priam. He was so blinded by the vision of his
glorious future that he did not think how heartless
he was to desert the loving and faithful Œnone, who
mourned for him until the hills echoed with the
sound of her cries.</p>

<p>To tell the story of Paris's return to his native
city, of his voyage to Sparta, and of his abduction
of Helen, would be to tell the story of the Trojan
war and of how dearly Paris and his household paid
for the most beautiful woman in the world. When
the sons of Priam were falling, one by one, beneath
the fierce blows of the Greeks, Paris was wounded
by a poisoned arrow shot by Philoctetes, who had
received these famous weapons from Hercules when
he lit that hero's funeral <span class="locked">pyre.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></span> As the poison entered
Paris's veins, and he knew that he had received
a mortal wound, he sent at once for Œnone, who
had always loved him so dearly that he believed she
must have forgiven his treachery and desertion. He
knew how skilled the nymph was in the use of healing
herbs, and she had once told him, in the happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
days of their love on Mount Ida, that if he ever were
wounded, he should send for her and she would
heal him. Paris therefore dispatched a messenger
in all haste to bring his wife from her home among
the hills; but Œnone refused to accompany the
messenger, for she knew that it was not for love of
her that her husband desired her presence. So
Paris died of his poisoned wound, and when Œnone
heard of his death, she went down to the city and
saw the funeral pyre with its flames leaping toward
the sky. Filled with remorse at her refusal to come
to his aid, Œnone could not look on at the sight of
Paris's burning body and live; so she sprang upon
the blazing pyre and perished beside her lover.</p>

<p>The principal temples of Jupiter were the Capitol
at Rome, and the Temple of Jupiter Ammon in
Libya. At Dodona was the oracle of Jupiter, called
the "Speaking Oak," where the responses were given
by the trees whose rustling branches made sounds
that were interpreted by the priests. The oracle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
was said to have been established at Dodona in the
following manner: two black doves took their flight
from Thebes in Egypt. One flew to Dodona in
Epirus; and alighting in a grove of oaks, it proclaimed,
in human language, to the people of that
region, that they must establish there an oracle of
Jupiter. The other dove flew to the temple of
Jupiter Ammon, and delivered a similar command
there. Another account says that two priestesses
were carried off from Thebes in Egypt by the
Phœnicians, and set up oracles at Dodona and the
Libyan Oasis.</p>

<p>A magnificent temple at Olympia was dedicated
to Jupiter, and here, every fifth year, the Greeks
assembled to celebrate games. These festivals lasted
five days, and were known as the Olympic Games.
Vast numbers of spectators flocked to them from
every part of Greece and from Asia, Africa, and
Sicily. The Greeks usually reckoned time by
Olympiads or five-year periods,&mdash;the space of time
between the celebrations. The first Olympiad was
about 776 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Inside the temple at Olympia stood a wonderful
statue of Jupiter made of ivory and gold. The
parts representing flesh were of ivory laid on a framework
of wood, while the drapery and ornaments were
of gold. It was the work of Phidias, and was considered
the highest achievement of Grecian sculpture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
The height of the figure was forty feet, and the
pedestal was twelve feet. The god was represented
as seated on his throne, with his brows crowned
with a wreath of olive and in his hand a scepter.
The statue was considered one of the Seven Wonders
of the world, but our knowledge of it is confined
to literary descriptions and to copies on coins.</p>

<p>Other mythologists than Ovid, in treating the
story of the flood, state that Deucalion and Pyrrha
took refuge in an ark, which, after sailing about for
many days, was stranded on the top of Mount
Parnassus. This version was far less popular with
the Greeks, though it shows more plainly the common
source from which all these myths are derived.</p>

<p>The city of Delphi, containing the famous oracle
of Apollo, was built on the slopes of Mount Parnassus
in Phocis. It had been observed at a very early
period that the goats feeding on Parnassus were
thrown into convulsions when they approached a
certain deep cleft in the side of the mountain.
When a goatherd ventured near the spot, he found
a peculiar vapor arising from the cavern, and as he
inhaled it, he was affected in the same way as the
animals had been. The inhabitants of the country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
unable to explain the goatherd's convulsive ravings,
imputed his utterings to divine inspiration. A
temple was therefore erected on the spot, and the
prophetic influence was attributed to various gods, but
was finally assigned only to Apollo. A priestess was
appointed who was named the Pythia, and her office
was to sit upon a tripod placed over the chasm
from which the divine afflatus proceeded. The
priestess and the tripod were both adorned with
laurel; and as she inhaled the hallowed air, her
words&mdash;believed to be inspired by Apollo&mdash;were
interpreted by the priests.</p>

<p>The Pythian Games were celebrated at Delphi
every three years, and were instituted by Apollo
in commemoration of his conquest of the Python.
At these games were chariot racing, running, leaping,
wrestling, throwing quoits, hurling javelins, and
boxing. Besides the exercises in bodily strength,
there were contests in music, poetry, and oratory.
These occasions gave the poets and musicians an
opportunity to show their productions to the public.</p>

<p>There was in Troy a celebrated statue of Minerva
called the Palladium. It was said to have fallen from
heaven, and the Trojans believed that the city could
not be taken so long as this statue remained within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
it. Ulysses and Diomede entered the city in disguise,
and succeeded in obtaining the Palladium,
which they carried off to the Grecian camp.</p>

<p>The finest and most celebrated of the statues of
Minerva was the one by Phidias in the Parthenon
at Athens. This was forty feet in height, and was
covered with ivory and gold. It represented the
goddess as standing with a spear in one hand, and in
the other a statue of victory. Her helmet, highly
decorated, was surmounted by a sphinx. The
Parthenon itself was constructed under the supervision
of the famous sculptor; and many of the reliefs
which enriched the exterior were by the hand
of Phidias himself. The statue of Minerva is not
in existence, but parts of the frieze of the Parthenon
are in the British Museum and are known as the
Elgin Marbles.</p>

<p>The hero Theseus instituted at Athens the festival
of Panathenæa in honor of Minerva. The chief
feature of the festival was a solemn procession in
which the Peplus, or sacred robe of Minerva, was
carried to the Parthenon, and left on or before the
statue of the goddess. The Peplus was covered with
embroidery worked by virgins of the noblest families
in Athens. The festival was peculiar to the
Athenians, but among them persons of all ages and
both sexes took part in the celebrations. In the
procession the old men carried olive branches and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
the young men bore arms. The women carried
baskets on their heads containing the sacred utensils
and cakes necessary for the sacrifices.</p>

<p>The most famous representations of Juno are the
torso in Vienna from Ephesus, the Barberini in the
Vatican at Rome, the bronze statuette in the Cabinet
of Coins and Antiquities in Vienna, and the Farnese
bust in the National Museum at Naples.</p>

<p>Juno's festivals, the Matronalia, in Rome, were
always celebrated with great pomp. Less important
feasts were held in each city where a temple was
dedicated to her. On one of these occasions, an old
priestess was very anxious to go to Juno's temple
at Argos, in which she had served the goddess many
years in her maiden days, and which she had left only
to be married. The way was long and difficult, and
the old priestess could not attempt to walk such a distance;
so she bade her sons Cleobis and Biton harness
her white heifers to her car. The youths were
anxious to do her bidding; but they could not find
the heifers, however diligently they searched. As
they did not wish to disappoint their mother who
had set her heart on attending the services, they
harnessed themselves to the car, and thus conveyed
her to the temple. The mother, touched by their
filial devotion, then prayed to Juno to bestow on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
her sons the greatest gift in her power; and when
the old priestess went in search of the youths, after
the services were over, she found them dead in the
portico of the temple where they had lain down to
rest. Juno had taken them, while they slept, to the
Elysian Fields to enjoy an eternity of bliss as a
reward for their devotion.</p>

<p>There is another version of the story of how
Hercules brought Alcestis back from Hades. This
is in the Alcestis of Euripides, and Browning has
related it in his "Balaustion's Adventure." In this
account the wife of Admetus is not surrendered
willingly by Pluto, but the great hero Hercules
wrestles with Death for the body and life of Alcestis,
and by winning the victory over this dread adversary,
restores Admetus's wife to his arms.</p>

<p>The combat between a hero and a dragon is a
favorite theme in mythology and folklore. Besides
the myth of Apollo's slaying of the Python are the
well-known stories of Siegfried's killing of Fafnir,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
St. George and the Dragon, Perseus and the Sea

<p>The principal temples dedicated to the worship

Delphi.</p>

<p>One of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world,
the famous Colossus of Rhodes, was a statue of
Apollo. His head was encircled with a halo of
bright sunbeams, and his legs were set wide apart to
allow vessels to pass in and out of the harbor with
all their sails spread.</p>

<p>Among the many remains of ancient sculpture,
none is better known&mdash;unless it be the Venus of
Milo&mdash;than the statue of Apollo called the Belvedere,
from the name of the apartment of the pope's
palace at Rome in which it is placed. The artist is
unknown, but the work is supposed to be of the
first century of our era, and is modeled on the type
of Greek sculpture of the Hellenistic period. It is
restored to represent the god at the moment when
he has shot the arrow that slays the Python.</p>

<p>Before Orion was slain by an arrow from Diana's
bow he loved Merope, daughter of Œnopion, king
of Chios, who consented to the union on condition
that the lover should win his bride by some heroic
deed. But instead of meeting this requirement,
Orion attempted to elope with Merope. The plan
was frustrated, however, by the king; and the bold
youth was punished by the loss of his bride and also
of his eyesight. Then Orion wandered about, blind
and helpless, and finally reached the Cyclops' cave,
where one of them took pity on him and led him to
the sun, from whose radiance his sight was restored.</p>

<p>The story of Endymion is a favorite theme in

<p>In the story of Hyacinthus, as told by the poet
Ovid in the "Metamorphoses" (Book 10, line 16,
etc.) the account says: "Behold the blood that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
flowed on the ground and stained the herbage
ceased to be blood; but a flower of hue more beautiful
than the Tyrian sprang up resembling the lily,
except that this is purple and that silvery white."
It is evident that the flower here described is not our
modern hyacinth, but some species of iris or larkspur.</p>

<p>Another unfortunate ending to one of the friendships
of Apollo was the death of Cyparissus, a clever
young hunter, whose companionship the sun-god often
sought. Cyparissus accidentally killed Apollo's pet
stag, and he grieved so sorely over this mischance
that he pined away and died. Apollo then changed
his body into a Cyprus tree, which the god declared
should henceforth be used to shade the graves of
those who, when living, were greatly beloved.</p>

<p>There were many oracles of Æsculapius, but the
most celebrated one was at Epidaurus. Here the
sick consulted the oracle and sought the recovery of
their health by sleeping in the temple. The treatment
of the sick was probably nothing like that of modern
therapeutics, but resembled what is now called animal
magnetism or mesmerism.</p>

<p>Serpents were sacred to Æsculapius, probably because
of the superstition that those animals have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
faculty of renewing their youth by a change of skin.
The worship of Æsculapius was introduced into
Rome in a time of great sickness, and an embassy
was sent to the temple at Epidaurus to implore the
help of the god. Æsculapius was so favorably inclined
to the petitioners that he accompanied the
returning ship in the form of a serpent. When
they reached the river Tiber, the serpent glided
from the vessel, and took possession of an island in
the river. Here a temple was later erected in honor
of Æsculapius.</p>

<p>According to the more ancient Greek conception,
Venus was the daughter of Jupiter and Dione,
goddess of moisture; but Hesiod says that she came
from the foam of the sea, and was therefore called
by the Greeks Aphrodite&mdash;the foam-born. She
was generally represented as a beautiful nude figure,
or wearing her wonderful girdle, the Cestus&mdash;in
which lay "love and desire and loving converse that
steals the wits even of the wise." The most famous
statue of Venus is the one that was found on the
island of Melos (Milo), and is now in the Louvre,
in Paris. It is probably the work of some sculptor
of about the third century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> He followed an
original of the age of Praxiteles, probably in bronze,
which represented the goddess, partly draped, gazing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
at her reflection in an uplifted shield. A masterpiece
of Praxiteles was the Venus of Cnidos, based upon
which are the Venus of the Capitoline in Rome, the
Venus de Medici in Florence, and the Venus of the
Vatican, which is much superior to the other two.</p>

<p>The worship of Aphrodite was probably of Semitic
origin, but was early introduced into Greece. The
Aphrodite of Homer and Hesiod displays both
Oriental and Grecian characteristics. Among the
Phœnicians Venus is known as Astarte, among the
Assyrians as Istar. There were temples and groves
dedicated to Venus in many places, and in some
of them&mdash;Paphos for instance&mdash;gorgeous annual
festivals were held. The festival of Venus that was
celebrated in Rome in April was called the Veneralia.</p>

<p>Sapho calls Aphrodite the "star-throned, incorruptible,
wile-weaving child of Zeus."</p>

<p>One of the many myths connected with Venus
was that of Berenice who, fearing for her husband's
life, prayed to the goddess to protect him as he set
out to battle. She vowed to give her beautiful hair
as a sacrifice to Venus if he returned home in
safety. The prayer was granted, and Berenice's
luxuriant tresses were laid on the goddess's shrine,
whence they soon mysteriously disappeared. When
an astrologer was consulted in regard to the supposed
theft, he pointed to a comet in the sky, and
declared that the gods had placed Berenice's hair
among the stars to shine forever in memory of her
wifely sacrifice.</p>

night in the year millions of Hindu women celebrate
a rite in honor of Savitri. The story is told in the
Mahabharata, an ancient epic of India.</p>

<p>Walter Pater, in "Marius the Epicurean," gives
the story of Cupid and Psyche as contained in
Apuleius. Many of the incidents of the story will
be found in modern fairy tales and romances such
as "Beauty and the Beast"; Grimm's "Twelve
Brothers"; the Gaelic stories: "The Three Daughters
of King O'Hara," "Fair, Brown and Trembling,"
"The Daughter of the Skies"; and the Norse
tale, "East of the Sun and West of the Moon."</p>

<p>The most amusing use made of the story of
Pyramus and Thisbe is in Shakespeare's "Midsummer-Night's
Dream," Act III, Sc. 2, and Act
V, Sc. 1, which is a burlesque of what was, in the
original story in Ovid, a tragedy.</p>

<p>Poems on "Hero and Leander" have been
written by Chistopher Marlowe, Leigh Hunt,
Thomas Hood, and Thomas Moore. Keats wrote
a sonnet, "On a Picture of Leander."</p>

<p>Byron attempted Leander's feat of swimming
across the Hellespont, a thing that was considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
impossible until the English poet proved its feasibility
by performing it himself. The distance in
the narrowest part is almost a mile, and there is a
constant current setting out from the Sea of Marmora.
Since Byron's time the swimming of the
Hellespont has been achieved by others; but it
still remains a test of strength and skill.</p>

<p>Various modern stories have been based upon the

"The Venus of Ille," by Prosper Mérimée.</p>

<p>Amphion had a twin brother named Zethus who,
however, had none of the musician's artistic ability.
The brothers heard that their mother Antiope had
been put aside by her second husband Lycus, in
order that he might marry another wife; so Amphion
and Zethus hastened to Thebes, where they found
things worse than they had imagined, for Antiope
was thrust into prison and subjected to very cruel
treatment. The brothers besieged the city; and,
after taking possession of it, put Lycus to death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
Then they tied Dirce, who had been the cause of
their mother's suffering, to the tail of a wild bull,
and let it drag her over the stones until she was

a famous piece of sculpture called the "Farnese
Bull" (as it once belonged to the Farnese family),
now in the National Museum at Naples.</p>

<p>Orpheus's lute was placed in the heavens as the
bright constellation Lyra.</p>

<p>The story of Orpheus and Eurydice is often
alluded to in poetry. Pope has used it to illustrate
the power of music in his "Ode for St. Cecilia's
Day," and the wonderful beauty of the nightingale's
song over the grave of Orpheus is alluded to by
Southey in his "Thalaba."</p>

<p>The song of the nightingale seemed to the ancients
so plaintive that, wishing to account for its sadness,
they invented the story of Philomela. King Tereus,
having wearied of his wife Procne, tore out her
tongue by the roots and then married her sister
Philomela, pretending that his wife was dead.
Procne informed her sister of the horrible truth by
means of a web into which she wove her story.
To revenge themselves upon the king, the sisters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
killed the boy Itylus (son of Tereus and Procne)
and served him up as food to his father. To punish
them for this wickedness the gods changed
Procne into a swallow, and Philomela into a nightingale,
which forever bemoans the murdered Itylus.
The king, Tereus, they transformed into a hawk.</p>

<p>The Muses were the daughters of Jupiter and
Mnemosyne, goddess of memory. Although they
sometimes united in one grand song, they had
separate duties and powers. Apollo as leader of the
choir of Muses was called Musagetes.</p>

<p>Clio, the Muse of history, recorded the great
deeds of heroes, and was usually represented with
a laurel wreath, and a book and stylus.</p>

<p>Euterpe, the Muse of lyric poetry, was represented
with a flute and garlands of flowers.</p>

<p>Thalia, the Muse of comedy, was also the patroness
of pastoral poetry, and so was often represented
with a shepherd's crook as well as a mask.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
Melpomene, the Muse of tragedy, wore a crown
of gold, and wielded a dagger and a scepter.</p>

<p>Terpsichore, the Muse of choral dance and song,
was usually portrayed in the act of dancing.</p>

<p>Erato, the Muse of love poetry, held a lyre.</p>

<p>Polyhymnia, the Muse of sacred poetry, also
presided over rhetoric.</p>

<p>Calliope, the Muse of epic and heroic poetry,
wore a laurel crown.</p>

<p>Urania, the Muse of astronomy, held mathematical
instruments.</p>

<p>As founder of Rome, Romulus was its first king,
and ruled over the people so tyrannically that the
senators determined to get rid of him. So one day
when an eclipse plunged the city into sudden darkness,
the senators killed Romulus, cut his body into
pieces, and hid them under their wide togas. When
daylight returned, and the people looked about for
their king,&mdash;for all the citizens had assembled on
the Forum,&mdash;the senators informed them that
Romulus had been carried off by the immortal gods
and would never return. After this Romulus was
worshiped as a god under the name of Quirinus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
and a temple was built on one of the seven hills
of Rome, which has since been known as Mount
Quirinal. Yearly festivals in honor of Romulus
were held in Rome under the name of Quirinalia.</p>

<p>Homer gives two versions of the story of Vulcan's
lameness,&mdash;one, that Jupiter threw him out of
heaven for helping his mother against Jupiter's
will; and the other, that he was born deformed, and
that Juno, ashamed of his ugliness, cast him out of
heaven.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) "Yea once ere this, when I was fain to save thee (Juno),
he caught me by my foot and hurled me from the heavenly threshold.
All day I flew, and at the set of sun I fell in Lemnos, and little
life was in me."</p>

<p>(2) "She (Thetis) delivered me when pain came upon me
from my great fall through the ill-will of my shameless mother who
would fain have hid me away for that I was lame."</p>

<p>He spake and from the anvil rose limping, a huge bulk, but under
him his slender legs moved nimbly. The bellows he set away from
the fire, and gathered all his gear wherewith he worked into a silver
chest; and with a sponge he wiped his face and hands and sturdy
neck and shaggy breast, and did on his doublet and took a stout
staff and went forth limping.&mdash;<i>Iliad</i>, Book I and Book XVIII.</p></blockquote>

<p>Vulcan's children were mostly monsters; but he
is also the reputed father of Servius Tullius, sixth
king of Rome, by a slave Ocrisia whom he visited
in the form of a bright flame, which played harmlessly
about her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
Vulcan was worshiped by all blacksmiths and
artisans; and great festivals, called the Vulcanalia
and the Hephæstia, were celebrated in his honor.</p>

<h3>XXXI</h3>

<p>There were many versions of the creation of the
world among the Greeks and Romans, but the most
popular was the following: At first there was nothing
but a confused mass in which land, sea, and air
were all merged in one substance. Over this shapeless
mass reigned a careless deity named Chaos who
shared his throne with his wife Nyx (or Nox) the
goddess of Night. They were dethroned by their
son Erebus (Darkness) who ruled over the universe
with his children Æther (Light) and Hemera (Day).
These two then succeeded to the throne, and by
their combined efforts, together with the help of
their own child Eros (Amor or Love) created
Pontus (the Sea) and Gæa (the Earth), also called
Ge, Tellus, Terra. The earth was divided into two
equal parts by Pontus, and around it flowed the
great river Oceanus. Soon Gæa created Uranus
(Heaven), and these two powerful deities took possession
of all the universe, and became the parents of
twelve gigantic children, the Titans, whose strength
was so great that their father Uranus grew much
afraid of them. To prevent their ever uniting against
him he hurled them, soon after their birth, into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
dark abyss called Tartarus, which was situated far
under the earth. Here he chained his six sons,
Oceanus, Cœus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus, and Saturn
(Cronos or Time) and his six daughters (also called
the Titanides), Ilia, Rhea, Themis, Thetis, Mnemosyne,
and Phœbe. Later on, Uranus thrust into
Tartarus his other children, the Cyclops, who made
the darkness hideous with their incessant clamor.</p>

<p>Gæa was not pleased at this treatment of her children,
so she descended into Tartarus to urge the
Titans to conspire against their father. But they
were all too fearful of the great Uranus and none
dared defy him except Saturn, who, having been
released from his chains by his mother, went out of
Tartarus armed with a scythe that Gæa had given
him. He came upon Uranus unawares, bound him
fast, and took possession of the throne. Then he
released his sisters and brothers, and the Titans, glad
to escape from their dreadful bondage, agreed to
accept Saturn as their ruler. He chose his sister
Rhea (Cybele) for his wife, and gave his brothers
and sisters different parts of the universe to govern.</p>

<p>Meanwhile old Uranus had told Saturn, when the
latter wrested from him his throne, that he himself
would one day be dethroned by his children. So
when Rhea bore her first son, Saturn determined to
defy the prophecy and promptly swallowed him.
One child after another was thus disposed of; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
at last Rhea resolved to save her youngest son by
stratagem. As soon as Jupiter was born, his mother
concealed him, and was able to persuade Saturn into
swallowing a large stone which she had wrapped in
swaddling clothes. Then Rhea intrusted her child
to the care of the Melian nymphs, who bore him
off to a cave on Mount Ida. Here a goat (Amalthea)
was procured as nurse, and it fulfilled its duties so
well that it was later placed in the heavens as a constellation.</p>

<p>When Rhea considered her son strong enough to
cope with his powerful father, she urged him to attack
Saturn, who, surprised at the sudden appearance of
a son of whose existence he was unaware, was defeated
and forced to resign his power to Jupiter. Then by
means of a nauseous drink prepared by Metis, a
daughter of Oceanus, Saturn was made to disgorge
the unfortunate children he had swallowed: Neptune,
Pluto, Vesta, Ceres, and Juno.</p>

<p>The river Alpheus does, in fact, disappear underground
in part of its course, finding its way through
subterranean channels until it again appears on the
surface. It was said that the Sicilian fountain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
Arethusa was the same stream that, after passing
under the sea, came up again in Sicily. Hence the
story arose that a cup thrown into the Alpheus
appeared again in Arethusa.</p>

<p>Many beautiful temples were dedicated to Ceres
and Proserpina, both in Greece and Italy; and their
yearly festivals, the Cerealia and Thesmophoria, were
celebrated with great pomp.</p>

<p>To commemorate her long search for her daughter,
Ceres instituted at Eleusis the Eleusinian Festivals
and Mysteries. The Festivals were held in
February and September. The lesser festival, in
February, represented the restoration of Proserpina
to her mother; the greater, held in September, lasted
nine days and represented the abduction of Proserpina.
All classes might participate in these festivals.
The Mysteries of Eleusis were witnessed only by
the initiated, and were surrounded with a veil of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
secrecy that has never been fully withdrawn. The
initiates passed through certain symbolic ceremonies
from one degree of mystic enlightenment to another
till the highest was attained. The Mysteries apparently
resembled the ceremonies of the modern
masonic orders.</p>

Jason, who was known exclusively as a god of

<p>The Furies visited the earth to punish filial disobedience,
irreverence to old age, perjury, murder,
treachery to guests, and even unkindness toward
beggars. They avenged the ghosts of those who
died by a violent death and had no one to avenge
them. Therefore they persecuted Orestes, who
killed his mother, and brought to punishment the
murderers of Ibycus. This poet, beloved by Apollo,
was journeying to the musical contest at Corinth,
and was attacked by two robbers. As he lay dying
he called upon a flock of cranes, that were passing
overhead, to take up his cause and avenge his
death. When his body was found, there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
great lamentation among the Greeks, and every
effort was made to discover the murderers, but without
success. Later on, when a vast assemblage was
witnessing a play in which the Chorus personated
the Furies, the people sat terrified and still as death
when the Choristers, clad in black, appeared bearing
in their fleshless hands torches blazing with a pitchy
flame. As they advanced with measured step, the
company could see their bloodless cheeks and the
writhing serpents that curled&mdash;in place of hair&mdash;around
their brows. Then they began to sing:
"Woe, woe to him who has done the deed of secret
murder. We, the fearful brood of night, fasten ourselves
upon him, flesh and soul. Unwearied we
pursue him; no pity checks our course; still on to
the end of life, we give no peace, no rest." As the
Furies finished their weird chant a number of dark
objects came sailing across the sky, and in the solemn
stillness that had fallen over the assembly a terrified
cry arose from one of the benches, "Look, comrade,
the cranes of Ibycus!" Having informed thus far
against themselves, it was not long before the
murderers were seized, and, having confessed their
crime, were put to death.</p>

<p>The effect upon the audience of this appearance
of the Furies (as related in the story of Ibycus) is
not exaggerated, for it is recorded that Æschylus,
the tragic poet, having on one occasion represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
the Furies in a chorus of fifty performers, the terror
of the spectators was such that many fainted and were
thrown into convulsions, and the magistrates forbade
a like representation for the future.</p>

<p>The story of the true and false Dreams and the
horn and ivory gates rests on a double play of
words: ἐλέφας (elephas), ivory, and ἐλεφαιρομαι

(keras), horn, and κραίνειν (krainein), to fulfill.</p>

<p>Dreams were sometimes sent through the gates
of horn to prepare mortals for misfortunes, as was
the case of Halcyone. Ceÿx, king of Thessaly,
once left his beloved wife, Halcyone, to go on a
journey to the oracle of Delphi. On the outgoing
voyage, a tempest struck the ship on which
the king was sailing, and he with all his crew perished
in the waves. Every day the queen went
down to the seashore to watch for the returning
vessel, and every night she prayed to the gods to
bring her husband safely back to her. Juno, knowing
that these prayers were in vain, pitied the faithful
Halcyone, and wished to prepare her for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
great sorrow that must soon come with the news of
Ceÿx's death. So she sent Iris to the cave of sleep,
and the rainbow goddess bade one of the Dreams
go forth from the gate of horn to visit the sleeping
queen. The Dream glided to Halcyone's bedside,
and, assuming the form of Ceÿx, appeared before her
pale, like a dead man, and dripping with the salt sea.
He told his wife that the storm had sunk his ship,
and that he himself was dead. Terrified at this
vision, Halcyone sprang from her couch and hastened
to the beach, where she found the body of her
husband washed up by the waves. In pity for her
grief, the gods changed both Halcyone and Ceÿx
into birds that ever afterward lived on the waters,
and were known as the Halcyon birds. These
birds uttered shrill cries of warning to all seamen
whenever a storm threatened, but were themselves
so fearless of the sea that they built their nests and
hatched their young on the ever-tossing waves.</p>

<p>The Nereides trained Arion, the wonderful
winged steed that had the power of speech, to draw
his father's chariot over the waves. He was said to
be the first and the fleetest of horses, and passed
successively into the hands of Cepreus (Pelops' son),
Hercules, and Adrastus&mdash;the last of whom won all
the chariot races, thanks to the fleetness of Arion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
Neptune was a patron of horse trainers, and was
himself especially devoted to horses.</p>

<p>The Cyclops are described differently by different
authors. Homer speaks of them as a gigantic and
lawless race of shepherds who dwelt in Sicily. Each
of them had a single eye in the center of his forehead.
The chief of the Cyclops was Polyphemus who fell
in love with the Nereid Galatea. He took great
care of his appearance, harrowed his coarse hair with
a currycomb and mowed his beard with a sickle.
When he looked into the sea, he smiled complacently
and said: "Beautiful seems my beard, beautiful also
my one eye&mdash;as I count beauty&mdash;and the sea reflects
the gleam of my teeth whiter than Parian
Stone" (Theocritus, Idyll VI.) Galatea did not
return the Cyclops's affection, however, for she loved
the river god Acis. Polyphemus came upon the
lovers one day in the woods, and was so enraged at
the sight of them that he killed his rival with a rock.
As the blood of Acis crept in a stream from under
the rock it grew paler and paler until it turned into
water. Soon it became a river which still bears the
name of the unfortunate Acis.</p>

<p>Palæmon was usually represented riding on a dolphin.
He was called Portumnus by the Romans,
and was believed to have jurisdiction over the ports
and shores. Some authorities state that the Isthmian
Games held on the isthmus of Corinth were
in honor of Neptune instead of Palæmon.</p>

<p>The divinities of the lakes, rivers, fountains, etc.,
were hoary river gods, slender youths, beautiful
maidens, and sometimes children. The famous
statue called "Father Nile" is in the Vatican at
Rome.</p>

<p>Bacchus was worshiped very widely throughout
the ancient world, and many festivals were held in
his honor. The most noted were the Greater and
Lesser Dionysia, the Liberalia, and the Bacchanalia.
Bacchus is generally represented as crowned with
ivy or grape leaves and bearing an ivy-circled wand
(the thyrsus). He rides in a chariot drawn by
panthers or leopards.</p>

are the Faun of Praxiteles (Vatican, copy); the
Dancing Faun (Lateran, Rome); Dancing Faun,
Sleeping Faun, Drunken Faun, and Faun and

<p>The Pygmies were a nation of dwarfs, so called
from a Greek word meaning the cubit or measure
of about thirteen inches, which was said to be the
height of these people. They lived near the sources
of the Nile, or, according to others, in India.
Homer tells us that the cranes used to migrate every
winter to the Pygmies' country, where they occasioned
a fierce warfare. H.&nbsp;M. Stanley, in his last African
expedition, discovered a race of diminutive men
that correspond very well in appearance to those
mentioned by Homer.</p>

<p>The most famous soothsayer was Melampus, who
was also the first mortal endowed with prophetic
powers. The story is told that before his house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
stood an oak tree containing a nest of serpents.
The old serpents were killed by some servants, but
Melampus took care of the young ones, and fed
them carefully. One day when he was sleeping
under the oak tree, the serpents licked his ears with
their tongues; and when he awoke he was surprised
to find that he now understood the languages of
birds and creeping things. In this way he was able
to foretell future events, and he became a celebrated
soothsayer. Once Melampus was taken captive and
put into prison; but he overheard the woodworms
saying that the timbers of the prison were so nearly
eaten through that the roof would soon fall in. He
told this to his captors, who immediately took advantage
of the warning and left the building; but not
before they rewarded Melampus by setting him free.</p>

<p>Dædalus shared with Æolus the honor of inventing
sails for the ships hitherto propelled by oars.</p>

<p>Dædalus could never bear the idea of a rival;
and when his nephew Perdix was apprenticed to
him, the lad gave such promise of excelling his
teacher in mechanical arts that Dædalus grew to
hate him. One day when Perdix was walking on
the seashore he picked up the spine of a fish, and
later on he imitated it in iron, thus inventing the
saw. He also invented a pair of compasses. Then
Dædalus, envious of his nephew's skill, pushed him
off a tower and killed him; but Minerva, pitying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
the boy, changed him into a partridge, which bears
his name.</p>

<p>Castor and Pollux were deities of boxing, wrestling,
and all equestrian exercises. They were generally
seen mounted on snow-white horses, and their
appearance on the battle-field was a good omen for
the army among whom they came. The Romans
believed that they fought at the head of their legions
at the famous battle of Lake Regillus.</p>

<p>In her "Characteristics of Women," Mrs. Jameson
has compared the character of Antigone with
that of Cordelia in Shakespeare's "King Lear." The
scene of Œdipus going alone into the forest at
Colonus is similar in pathos and tragedy to Lear's
defiance of the midnight tempest on the lonely
heath.</p>

holding a scepter, and soothes their feeling and softens their wrath.
If he did not do this, they would surely carry with them in rapid
course the seas and lands and the deep sky and sweep these with
them to the high heavens.</p></div>

all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
